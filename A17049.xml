            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing in this world, nor out of this world, more to be wiÅ¿hed of euery one of you, more to be craued, and Å¿ought, of euery one of you, then to bee conioyned with ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, then once to be made one, with the God of glory, ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us. This heauenly, and celeÅ¿tiall coniunction, is purchaÅ¿ed and brought about, by two Å¿peciall meanes; It is brought about, by meanes of the word and preaching of the GoÅ¿pell: and it is brought about, by the meanes of the Sacraments, and miniÅ¿tration thereof.
<pb facs="tcp:20181:4"/>The word leadeth vs to ChriÅ¿t, by the eare; the Sacraments, lead vs to ChriÅ¿t, by the eye: Two Å¿enÅ¿es, of all the reÅ¿t, which God hath choÅ¿en, as moÅ¿t meet for this purpoÅ¿e, to inÅ¿truct vs, and bring vs vnto ChriÅ¿t. For that doctrine muÅ¿t be moÅ¿t effectuall, &amp; mouing, that wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and Å¿tirreth vp moÅ¿t of the outward Å¿enÅ¿es: that doctrine, that wakeneth not onely the eare, but the eye, the taÅ¿te, the feeling, and all the reÅ¿t of the outward Å¿enÅ¿es, muÅ¿t moue the heart moÅ¿t, muÅ¿t be moÅ¿t effectuall, and pearcing in the Å¿oule. But Å¿o it is, that this doctrine of the Sacraments, moues, Å¿tirres vp, and wakens moÅ¿t of the outward Å¿enÅ¿es, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muÅ¿t bee (if wee come well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto it) moÅ¿t effectuall to Å¿tirre vp the inward Å¿enÅ¿es of the dull heart. But there is a thing, that yee muÅ¿t euer remember; there is no doctrine, neither of the Å¿imple word, nor yet of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, if ChriÅ¿t abÅ¿tract his holy Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is able to moue: therefore, when euer yee come to heare the doctrine, whether it be of the Sacraments, or of the Å¿imple word, craue of God, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20181:4"/>hee would be preÅ¿ent by his holy Å¿pirit, or otherwiÅ¿e all the doctrine in the earth will not awaile you. Alwaies, this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Sacraments, Å¿tirres vp, and wakens moÅ¿t of the outward Å¿enÅ¿es, and therefore there is no queÅ¿tion, but it is an effectuall, and potent inÅ¿trument, to waken, prepare, and Å¿tirre vp our hearts.</p>
            <p>Then to let you Å¿ee what the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament meaneth:
<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿e ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> and to remoue the ambiguitie of it, it is certaine, and out of all queÅ¿tion, that the Latine Diuines, who were moÅ¿t ancient, did interpret the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, by the word Sacrament; and they vÅ¿ed the Greeke word, not onely to Å¿ignifie the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Supper of the Lord, and the whole action of BaptiÅ¿me: but they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed the word MyÅ¿tery, to Å¿ignifie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer is darke, and bid in it Å¿elfe, and not frequented in the common vÅ¿e of men: as after this manner, the ApoÅ¿tle calleth the vocation of the Gentiles a myÅ¿terie.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>EpheÅ¿</hi> 3.9. <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 5.32.</note> This coniunction which is begun heere betwixt vs and ChriÅ¿t, is called a MyÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and the Latine Interpreters, call it a
<pb facs="tcp:20181:5"/>Sacrament: and to be Å¿hort, ye will not finde in the booke of God a word more frequent, then the word MyÅ¿terie. But as for the word Sacrament, wherby they interpret the Greeke word, we finde not this word by the Å¿ame Diuines to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Å¿o largely; neither is it take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿o large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in any part of the booke of God. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the word Sacrament, is very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous in it Å¿elfe, and there ariÅ¿eth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ambiguitie of this word many controuerÅ¿ies, which are not yet ceaÅ¿ed, nor will not ceaÅ¿e while the world la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teth: whereas if they had kept the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles words, and called them as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle calleth them, Signes, and Seales; all this digladiation, Å¿trife and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appearingly had not fallen out: but where men will be wiÅ¿er then God, and giue names to things without warrant from God, vpon the wit of man, which is but meere folly, all this Å¿tirre falleth out. Well then, to come vnto the purpoÅ¿e; The ancient Diuines tooke the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as we may perceiue, in a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner: Sometime they tooke it for the whole action; that is, the whole
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20181:5"/>miniÅ¿tery of the Elements: Å¿ometime, they tooke it not for the whole action, but for the outward things, that are vÅ¿ed in the action of BaptiÅ¿me, and of the Supper, as they tooke it, for the vvater, and Å¿prinkling of it; for the Bread and Wine breaking, diÅ¿tributing, and eating thereof. Thirdly againe, they tooke it not for the whole outward things, that are vÅ¿ed in the action, but onely for the materiall, and earthly things, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: as, for Bread and Wine in the Supper, and water in BaptiÅ¿me. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Å¿ort, Å¿aith <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked eate the body of our Lord, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacrament onely, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Elements onely. LaÅ¿t of all they tooke it not only for the Elements, but for the things Å¿ignified by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And after this manner, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Å¿aith, that a Sacrament Å¿tandeth of two things: the one, earthly; the other, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly. The ancient Diuines then, taking the word after theÅ¿e Å¿orts, no queÅ¿tion, all theÅ¿e waies they tooke it rightly.</p>
            <p>But leauing the ambiguitie of the word, I take the word Sacrament, as it is
<pb facs="tcp:20181:6"/>taken, and vÅ¿ed this day in the Church of GOD, for a holy Signe and Seale that is annexed to the preached word of God, to Å¿eale vp and confirme the truth contained in the Å¿ame vvord: Å¿o that I call not the Å¿eale, Å¿eparated from the vvord a Sacrament. For, as there can not bee a Å¿eale, but that which is the Å¿eale of an euidence, and if the Å¿eale be Å¿eparated from the euidence, it is not a Å¿eale, but looke what it is by nature, it is no more: So there cannot bee a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, except it bee annexed to the euidence of the vvord; but looke what the Sacrament was by nature, it is no more. Was it a common peece of bread? it remaines common bread, except it be ioyned to the euidence of the vvord. Therefore the vvord onelie cannot be a Sacrament, nor the element onely, cannot be a Sacrament; but the vvord and element coniunctly, muÅ¿t make a Sacrament. And Å¿o <hi>Augustine</hi> Å¿aid well, Let the vvord come to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Å¿o yee Å¿hall haue a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So then, the vvord muÅ¿t come to the element: that is, the vvord prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20181:6"/>diÅ¿tinctly, and all the parts of it opened vp, muÅ¿t goe before the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to of the Å¿acrament; and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a Å¿eale muÅ¿t follow, and Å¿o be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued accordingly.</p>
            <p>Then I call a Sacrament, the vvord and Å¿eale coniunctly, the one hung to the other. It is without all controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie, and there is no doubt in it, that all Sacraments are Å¿ignes: Now if a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be a Å¿igne, as the Å¿igne is in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that <hi>Category,</hi> for Å¿o wee muÅ¿t Å¿peake it: Å¿o the Sacrament muÅ¿t be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that Å¿ame <hi>Category</hi> of relation. Now euery relation againe muÅ¿t Å¿tand of force betwixt two things; for one thing cannot bee the correlatiue of it Å¿elfe: but in a lawfull relation, of force there muÅ¿t be two things, which two, haue euer a mutuall reÅ¿pect the one to the other: therfore, in euery Sacrament that hath a relation, there muÅ¿t be two things, which two haue euer a mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect the one to the other.</p>
            <p>Take away one of theÅ¿e two things from the Sacrament, ye loÅ¿e the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; &amp; loÅ¿ing the relation, ye loÅ¿e the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
<pb facs="tcp:20181:7"/>Confound any of theÅ¿e two with the other, make either a confuÅ¿ion or permixtion of them, ye loÅ¿e the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and loÅ¿ing the relation, ye loÅ¿e the Sacrament. Turne ouer the one into the other, Å¿o that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the one, Å¿tarts vp, and vaniÅ¿heth in the other; yee loÅ¿e the relation, and Å¿o yee loÅ¿e the Sacrament. Then as in euery Sacrament there is a relation; Å¿o to keepe the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yee muÅ¿t euer keepe two things Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally in the Sacrament.</p>

            <p>Now, to beginne at the Å¿ignes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Å¿eeing all Sacraments are Å¿ignes,
<note place="margin">The Å¿ignes in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> what call wee the Å¿ignes in the Sacrament? I call the Å¿ignes in the Sacrament, whatÅ¿oeuer I perceiue, and take vp by my outward Å¿enÅ¿es, by mine eye eÅ¿pecially. Now ye Å¿ee in this Sacrament, there are two Å¿orts of things Å¿ubiect to the outward Å¿enÅ¿es, &amp; to the eye eÅ¿pecially: yee Å¿ee the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine are Å¿ubiect to mine eye; therfore they muÅ¿t be Å¿ignes. Yee Å¿ee againe, that the rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whereby theÅ¿e Elements are diÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, broken, and giuen, are Å¿ubiect to mine eye alÅ¿o: Then I muÅ¿t make two Å¿orts of Å¿ignes; one Å¿ort of the Bread and the Wine, and we call them Elementall: another Å¿ort of the rites &amp; ceremonies, whereby theÅ¿e are diÅ¿tributed, broken,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:8"/>and giuen, and wee call them ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. Be not deceiued with the vvord Ceremonie; thinke not, that I call the breaking of the Bread, the eating of the Bread, and drinking of the Wine, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: thinke not that they are vaine, as yee vÅ¿e that word Ceremonie for a vaine thing, which hath no grace, nor profit, following after it. No, although I call them Ceremonies, there is neuer a Ceremonie which ChriÅ¿t inÅ¿tituted in this Supper, but it is as eÅ¿Å¿entiall, as the Bread and Wine are, and yee cannot leaue one iot of them, except yee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the whole inÅ¿titution: for what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ChriÅ¿t commaunded to be done, what euer he Å¿pake, or did, in that whole action, it is eÅ¿Å¿entiall, and muÅ¿t be done; and yee cannot leaue one iot thereof, but yee vvill peruert the vvhole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The reaÅ¿on, wherefore I call them Å¿ignes,
<note place="margin">Why they are called Å¿ignes.</note> is this: I call them not Å¿ignes by that reaÅ¿on that men commonly call them Å¿ignes, becauÅ¿e they Å¿ignifie onely; as the Bread Å¿ignifies the body of ChriÅ¿t, &amp; the Wine Å¿ignifies the bloud of ChriÅ¿t:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20181:8"/>I call them not Å¿ignes becauÅ¿e they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿ent onely; but I call them Å¿ignes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they haue the body and bloud of ChriÅ¿t conioyned with them. Yea, Å¿o truly is the body of ChriÅ¿t conioyned with that Bread, and the bloud of ChriÅ¿t conioyned with that Wine, that as Å¿oone as thou receiueÅ¿t that Bread in thy mouth (if thou be a faithful man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) Å¿o Å¿oone receiueÅ¿t thou the bodie of ChriÅ¿t in thy Å¿oule, and that by faith: and as Å¿oone as thou receiueÅ¿t that Wine in thy mouth, Å¿o Å¿oone thou receiueÅ¿t the bloud of ChriÅ¿t in thy Å¿oule, and that by faith: In reÅ¿pect of this exhibition chiefely, that they are inÅ¿truments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer, and exhibite the things that they Å¿ignifie, and not in reÅ¿pect onely of their repreÅ¿entation, are they called Å¿ignes. For if they did nothing but repreÅ¿ent, or Å¿ignifie a thing abÅ¿ent; then any picture, or dead Image Å¿hould be a Sacrament: for there is no picture, as the picture of the King, but at the Å¿ight of the picture, the King vvill come in your minde, and it vvill Å¿ignifie vnto you, that, that is the Kings picture: So, if the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:9"/>Å¿igne of the Sacrament did no further, all pictures Å¿hould bee Sacraments: but in reÅ¿pect the Sacrament exhibites, and deliuers the thing that it Å¿ignifieth, to the Å¿oule and hart, Å¿o Å¿oone as the Å¿igne is deliuered to the mouth, for this cauÅ¿e eÅ¿pecially, it is called a Å¿igne. There is no picture of the King, that will deliuer the King vnto you; there is no other Image, that will exhibite the thing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is the Image: therefore there is no Image can be a Sacrament. Then, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect the Lord hath appointed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as hands to deliuer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite the thing Å¿ignified, for this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, and exhibition chiefely, they are called Å¿ignes. As the word of the GoÅ¿pel, is a mighty &amp; potent inÅ¿trument to our euerlaÅ¿ting Å¿aluation: Å¿o the Sacrament is a potent inÅ¿trument, appointed by GOD, to deliuer vs to ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, to our euerlaÅ¿ting Å¿aluation. For this Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meat, is dreÅ¿Å¿ed, and giuen vp to vs in Å¿pirituall diÅ¿hes: that is, in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿tery of the word, and in the miniÅ¿tery of the Sacraments. And Å¿uppoÅ¿e this miniÅ¿tery be externall, yet the Lord is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20181:9"/>Å¿aid to deliuer Å¿pirituall, and heauenlie things, by theÅ¿e externall things. Why? BecauÅ¿e hee hath appointed them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments, whereby he will deliuer his owne Sonne vnto vs. For this is certain, that none hath power to deliuer ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us vnto vs, except God, and his holy Å¿pirit: and therefore, to Å¿peake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is none can deliuer ChriÅ¿t, but God by his owne Å¿pirit: hee is deliuered by the miniÅ¿tery of the holy Spirit; it is the holy Spirit, that Å¿eales him vp in our harts, and confirmes vs more and more in him: as the ApoÅ¿tle giues him this Å¿tile, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.</p>
            <p>To Å¿peak properly, there is none hath power to deliuer ChriÅ¿t, but GOD the Father, or himÅ¿elfe. There is none hath power to deliuer the Mediator, but his owne Å¿pirit: yet it hath pleaÅ¿ed GOD, to vÅ¿e Å¿ome inÅ¿truments and means, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee will deliuer ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us vnto vs. The meanes are theÅ¿e; the miniÅ¿tery of the vvord, and the miniÅ¿tery of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; and in reÅ¿pect he vÅ¿eth theÅ¿e as meanes, to deliuer ChriÅ¿t, they are Å¿aid to deliuer him. But heere yee haue
<pb facs="tcp:20181:10"/>to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h, between the principall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient deliuerer, and the inÅ¿trumentall efficient; which is, the word, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts: keeping this diÅ¿tinction, both theÅ¿e are true; GOD by his word, and GOD by his Å¿pirit, deliuereth ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us vnto you. Then I Å¿ay, I cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Å¿ignes, becauÅ¿e God hath made them potent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments, to deliuer that Å¿ame thing which they Å¿ignifie.</p>
            <p>Now I goe to the thing Å¿ignified, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and I call the thing Å¿ignified by the Å¿ignes in the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">What is the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Sacrament.</note> that, which <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that old Writer, calleth, the heauenly &amp; Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing: to wit, whole ChriÅ¿t, with his whole gifts, benefites, and graces, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, &amp; giuen to my Å¿oule. Then I call not the thing Å¿ignified, by the Å¿ignes of Bread and Wine; the benefits of ChriÅ¿t, the graces of ChriÅ¿t, or the vertue that floweth out of ChriÅ¿t onely: but I call the thing Å¿ignified, together with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, and vertues flowing from him, the very Å¿ubÅ¿tance of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, from which this vertue dooth flowe. The Å¿ubÅ¿tance, with the vertues, gifts, and graces, that flowe from the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20181:10"/>is the thing Å¿ignified heere. As for the vertue and graces that flow from ChriÅ¿t, it is not poÅ¿sible that thou canÅ¿t be partaker of the vertue that floweth from his Å¿ubÅ¿tance, except thou be firÅ¿t partaker of the Å¿ubÅ¿tance it Å¿elfe. For how is it poÅ¿sible, that I can be partaker of the iuyce that floweth out of any Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, except I be partaker of the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance it Å¿elfe firÅ¿t?</p>
            <p>Is it poÅ¿sible that my Å¿tomach can bee refreÅ¿hed with that meat, the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance vvhereof came neuer in my mouth? Is it poÅ¿sible my drouth can be Å¿lackned with that drinke, that paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed neuer downe my throat? Is it poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible, that I can Å¿ucke any vertue out of anie thing, except I gette the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance firÅ¿t? So it is impoÅ¿sible, that I can get the iuyce &amp; vertue, that floweth out of ChriÅ¿t, except I get the Å¿ubÅ¿tance, that is himÅ¿elfe, firÅ¿t. So I call not the thing Å¿ignified, the grace, &amp; vertue that floweth from ChriÅ¿t onelie; nor ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, and his Å¿ubÅ¿tance, without his vertue &amp; graces onely; but ioyntly, the Å¿ubÅ¿tance with the graces, whole ChriÅ¿t,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:11"/>God, and man, without Å¿eparation of his natures, without diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing of his Å¿ubÅ¿tance from his graces.</p>
            <p>I call the thing Å¿ignified, by the Å¿ignes in the Sacrament: for why? if no more be Å¿ignified by the Bread, but the fleÅ¿h, and body of ChriÅ¿t onely, and no more be Å¿ignified by the Wine, but the bloud of ChriÅ¿t onely, thou canÅ¿t not Å¿ay, that the body of ChriÅ¿t, is ChriÅ¿t; it is but a part of ChriÅ¿t: thou canÅ¿t not Å¿ay, that the blood of ChriÅ¿t, is whole ChriÅ¿t; it is but a part of him: and a peece of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, Å¿aued thee not; a part of thy Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, wrought not the worke of thy Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: and Å¿o Å¿uppoÅ¿e thou get a peece of him in the Sacrament, that part will doe thee no good.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore, that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may nouriÅ¿h thee to life euerlaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou muÅ¿t get in it thy whole Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whole ChriÅ¿t, God, and man, with his whole graces, and benefites, without Å¿eparation of his Å¿ubÅ¿tance, from his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or of the one nature, from the other. And how get I him? Not by my mouth. It is a vaine thing to think, that wee will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20181:11"/>get God by our mouth: but we get him by faith. As hee is a Å¿pirit, Å¿o I eate him by faith; and belieue in my Å¿oule, not by the teeth of my mouth: that is a vaine thing. Be it, that thou mighteÅ¿t eate the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t with thy teeth, this were a cruel maner of doing; yet thou maiÅ¿t not eate the God-head with thy teeth: this is a groÅ¿s faÅ¿hion of Å¿peaking. Then if euer yee get good of the Sacrament, ye muÅ¿t get whole ChriÅ¿t; and there is not any inÅ¿trument whereby to lay hold on him, but by faith onely: therefore come with a faithfull hart.</p>
            <p>O, but yee will aske mee (and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the definition layd downe of the thing Å¿ignified, giues a ground to it) If the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, <label type="milestone">

               </label> and the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, bee a part of the thing Å¿ignified, how can I call his fleÅ¿h a Å¿pirituall thing; and ChriÅ¿t, in reÅ¿pect of his fleÅ¿h, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thing? Yee will not Å¿ay, that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of ChriÅ¿tes fleÅ¿h is Å¿pirituall, or that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of his bloud, is Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; vvherefore then call ye it an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, and Å¿piritual thing? I wil tell you. The fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, is called a Å¿pirituall
<pb facs="tcp:20181:12"/>thing, and ChriÅ¿t is called Å¿pirituall, in reÅ¿pect of his fleÅ¿h: not, that his fleÅ¿h is become a Å¿pirit; or that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of his fleÅ¿h, is become Å¿pirituall. No, it remaineth true fleÅ¿h, and the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of it, is one, as it was in the wombe of the Virgin. His fleÅ¿h is not called Å¿pirituall, in reÅ¿pect it is glorified in the heauens, at the right hand of the Father; be not deceiued with that: for Å¿uppoÅ¿e it be glorified, yet it remaineth true fleÅ¿h, that Å¿ame verie fleÅ¿h which hee tooke out of the wombe of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Neither is it Å¿pirituall, becauÅ¿e thouÅ¿eeÅ¿t it not in the Supper; if thou wert where it is,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">AnÅ¿were. </seg>
               </label> thou mighteÅ¿t Å¿ee it: But it is called Å¿pirituall, in reÅ¿pect of the Å¿pirituall ends wherunto it Å¿erues to my body &amp; Å¿oule, becauÅ¿e the fleÅ¿h &amp; bloud of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿erueth to nouriÅ¿h me, not to a temporall, but to a Å¿pirituall, &amp; heauenly life. Now, in reÅ¿pect this fleÅ¿h is a Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual foode, Å¿eruing me to a Å¿pirituall life, for this cauÅ¿e it is called a Å¿pirituall thing: if it nouriÅ¿h mee, as the fleÅ¿h of beaÅ¿ts doth, but to a temporall life, it Å¿hould be called but a temporall thing:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20181:12"/>but in reÅ¿pect it nouriÅ¿heth my Å¿oule, not to an earthly and temporall life, but to an heauenly, celeÅ¿tiall, and Å¿pirituall end; In reÅ¿pect of this end, the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, and ChriÅ¿t in reÅ¿pect of his fleÅ¿h, is called the Å¿pirituall thing in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is called alÅ¿o the Å¿piritual thing in the Sacrament, in reÅ¿pect of the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall inÅ¿trument, whereby it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The inÅ¿trument whereby the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t is receiued, is not a corporall inÅ¿trument; is not the teeth, and mouth of the body; but it is Å¿pirituall; it is the mouth of the Å¿oule, which is faith: and in reÅ¿pect the inÅ¿trument is Å¿pirituall, therefore ChriÅ¿t, who is receiued, is alÅ¿o called Å¿pirituall. In reÅ¿pect alÅ¿o, that the manner of receiuing, is a heauenly, Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and internall manner; not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, nor externall manner: in reÅ¿pect that the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, which is giuen in the Sacrament, is receiued by a Å¿piritual, &amp; Å¿ecret maner, which is not Å¿eene to the eyes of men; In all theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, I call ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us the heauenly and Å¿pirituall thing, which is Å¿ignified by the Å¿ignes in the Sacrament.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:13"/>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">The thing Å¿ignified, muÅ¿t be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> I Å¿ay in the end, the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied muÅ¿t bee applyed to vs. What auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it me, to Å¿ee my medicine in a box, Å¿tanding in an Apothecaries Å¿hop? what can it worke toward me, if it be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed?

            <p>Thus farre of the thing Å¿ignified. Vnto this generall conÅ¿ideration, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth theÅ¿e things yet to bee made plaine vnto you: FirÅ¿t, how the Å¿ignes, and the thing Å¿ignified are coupled together, and how they are conioyned. Next, it reÅ¿tes to be told you, how the Å¿igne is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and hovv the thing Å¿ignified is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, and hovv both are receiued, as vvell as they are deliuered. This bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, I Å¿hall Å¿peake briefely of the other part of the Sacrament, vvhich is the vvord. And laÅ¿t of all, I Å¿hall let you
<pb facs="tcp:20181:15"/>Å¿ee, what Å¿ort of faults they are, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the Sacrament, and make it of no effect. And if time Å¿hall Å¿erue, I Å¿hall enter in particular, to this Sacrament which wee haue in hand.</p>
            <p>Then to come back againe; In the third place,
<note place="margin">How the Å¿igne &amp; the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> it is to be conÅ¿idered, how the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, are coupled: For, about this coniunction, all the debate Å¿tands; all the Å¿trifes, that we haue vvith them that varie from the Å¿treight truth, Å¿tand about the matter of this coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some will haue them conioyned one way, and Å¿ome, after another way; &amp; men Å¿triue very bitterly about this matter; and continue Å¿o in Å¿trife, that through the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneÅ¿Å¿e of contention, they loÅ¿e the truth: for when the heat of contention ariÅ¿eth, &amp; eÅ¿pecially in diÅ¿putation, they take no heed to the truth, but to the victory. If they may be victorious, and it were but by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of words, they regard not, Å¿uppoÅ¿e they loÅ¿e the truth. Read their works, and bookes about this coniunction, and you will craue, rather conÅ¿cience, then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: yea, if they had the quarter of the conÅ¿cience, that they haue of knowledge, no queÅ¿tion, this controuerÅ¿ie might bee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20181:15"/>eaÅ¿ily taken vp: but men lacking conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hauing knowledge, an euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience peruerts the knowledge, &amp; drawes them to an euill end.</p>
            <p>To tell you now, how theÅ¿e two are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, it will be farre eaÅ¿ier for mee, and better for you to vnderÅ¿tand, to tell you firÅ¿t, how they are not conioyned: for I Å¿hall make it very cleere vnto you, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you Å¿ee how they are not conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but it is not poÅ¿sible to make it Å¿o cleere, by telling you the manner, hovv they are conioyned. Yee may perceiue cleerely by your eyes, that the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, are not locally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned: that is, they are not both in one place. Yee may perceiue alÅ¿o by your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Å¿enÅ¿es, that the body of ChriÅ¿t, which is the thing Å¿ignified, &amp; the Å¿ignes, are not conioyned corporally, their bodies touch not each other. You may perceiue alÅ¿o, they are not viÅ¿ibly conioyned, they are not both Å¿ubiect to the outward eye: So it is eaÅ¿ie to let you Å¿ee, how they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned. For if the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified were viÅ¿ibly, and corporally conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what need were there for vs to haue a Å¿igne? Wherefore Å¿hould the Å¿igne in the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:16"/>Sacrament Å¿erue vs? Is not the Å¿igne in the Sacrament, appointed to leade mee to ChriÅ¿t? Is not the Å¿igne appointed to point out ChriÅ¿t vnto mee? If I Å¿aw him preÅ¿ent by mine owne eye, as I doe the Bread, vvhat need had I of the Bread? Therefore ye may Å¿ee cleerely, that there is no Å¿uch thing, as a corporall, naturall, or any Å¿uch like phyÅ¿icall coniunction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified: So I Å¿ay, it is eaÅ¿ie to let you Å¿ee, how they are not conioyned.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs Å¿ee how they are conioyned. VVe cannot craue heere any other Å¿ort of coniunction, then may Å¿tand &amp; agree with the nature of the Sacrament: for, nothing can be conioyned with another, after any other Å¿ort, then the nature of it will Å¿uffer; therefore, there cannot be heere any other Å¿ort of coniunction, then the nature of the Sacrament will Å¿uffer. Now, the nature of the Sacrament, will Å¿uffer a Sacramentall coniunction. O, but that is hard yet, yee are neuer the better for this; but I Å¿hall make it cleere by Gods grace. Yee knowe euery Sacrament is a myÅ¿terie; there is not a Sacrament but it containes a high, &amp; diuine myÅ¿terie. In reÅ¿pect then, that a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20181:16"/>Sacrament is a myÅ¿terie, it followeth, that a myÅ¿ticall Å¿ecret, and Å¿pirituall coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, agreeth well vvith the nature of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>As the coniunction betweene vs, and ChriÅ¿t, is full of myÅ¿terie, as the ApoÅ¿tle lets you Å¿ee, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.32. that it is a myÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and Å¿pirituall coniunction: So no doubt, the coniunction between the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the thing Å¿ignified in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, muÅ¿t be of that Å¿ame nature, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall, and Å¿pirituall. It is not poÅ¿sible to tel you, by any ocular demonÅ¿tration, how ChriÅ¿t and we are conioyned. But whoÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer would vnderÅ¿tand that coniunction, his minde muÅ¿t be enlightened vvith an heauenly eye; that as he hath an eye in his head, to Å¿ee corporall things: Å¿o he muÅ¿t haue in his mind &amp; hart, an heauenly eye, to Å¿ee this myÅ¿ticall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>iunction; a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eye, to take vp this Å¿ecret coniunction, that is betwixt the Å¿onne of God, and vs, in the Sacrament. So I need not to inÅ¿iÅ¿t any longer heerupon: except ye haue this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly illumination, yee can neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand neither your own coniunction with ChriÅ¿t, nor yet the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>iunction between the Å¿ign, &amp; the thing Å¿ignified in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:17"/>
            <p>But I keepe my ground: As the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a myÅ¿terie; Å¿o the coniunction that is in the Sacrament, no doubt muÅ¿t be a myÅ¿ticall Å¿ecret, and Å¿pirituall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. BeÅ¿ides this, I will let you Å¿ee by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deduction, that in euery Sacrament, are two things; which two, haue a relation, and mutuall reÅ¿pect the one to the other: Å¿o that a relatiue coniunction, agreeth wel with the nature of the Sacrament. Then wilt thou aske, what kinde of coniunction it is? I anÅ¿were, the coniunction that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth in nature: to wit, a relatiue, and a reÅ¿pectiue coniunction; Å¿uch a coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein the Å¿igne hath a continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect to the thing Å¿ignified; and the thing Å¿ignified, to the Å¿igne.</p>
            <p>Then, would you knowe in a word, the kinde of coniunction, that is betweene the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified? I call it a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and a myÅ¿ticall coniunction, that Å¿tandeth in a mutuall relation, betweene the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified. There is another coniunction, beÅ¿ides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction that is betweene ChriÅ¿t and vs, that may make this coniunction betwixt the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, more cleere: and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20181:17"/>which is between the word which you heare,
<note place="margin">This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction is made cleer, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the word, &amp; the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ied therby.</note> and the thing Å¿ignified by the Å¿ame word. Mark what Å¿ort of coniunction is betweene the word which you heare, and the thing Å¿ignified which commeth into your minde; the like coniunction is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Å¿igne that you Å¿ee, and the thing Å¿ignified in the Sacrament. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue eaÅ¿ily, that there is a coniunction, by the effect, although you cannot Å¿o vvell knowe the manner of coniunction. And why? You heare not the word Å¿o Å¿oon Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by mee, but incontinent, the thing, which my words whereof I Å¿peak, Å¿ignifie, commeth into your minde. If I Å¿peake of things paÅ¿t, of things to come, or of things that are neuer Å¿o farre abÅ¿ent, I can no Å¿oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Å¿peak to you of them in this language, but preÅ¿ently the thing Å¿ignified, commeth into your minde; no doubt, becauÅ¿e there is a coniunction between the word, and the thing Å¿ignified: So euery one of you may eaÅ¿ily perceiue, that there is a coniunction between the word, and the thing Å¿ignified by the word. As for example: SuppoÅ¿e <hi>Paris</hi> be far diÅ¿tant from vs; yet if I Å¿peake of <hi>Paris,</hi> the word is no Å¿ooner Å¿poken, but the Citie will come into your minde. If I
<pb facs="tcp:20181:18"/>Å¿peake of the King, although hee be farre diÅ¿tant from vs, the word is no Å¿ooner Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the thing Å¿ignified will come into your mind: So this comming of the thing Å¿ignified into the hart, and minde, maketh it plaine vnto you, that there is a coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene the word, and the thing Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the word.</p>
            <p>To tell you of this Å¿ort of coniunction, it is not Å¿o eaÅ¿ie, becauÅ¿e the thing Å¿ignified is not preÅ¿ent vnto the eye, as the word is to the eare. If euery thing Å¿ignified, were as preÅ¿ent vnto your eye, as the word is to your eare, it were eaÅ¿ie to Å¿ee the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but novv Å¿eeing the coniunction is myÅ¿ticall, Å¿ecret, and Å¿pirituall, therefore it is hard to make you to vnderÅ¿tand it: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obÅ¿erue, What coniunction is between the Å¿imple word, and the thing Å¿ignified by the word; the Å¿ame kinde of coniunction, is between the Sacrament, and the thing Å¿ignified by the Sacrament: for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is no other thing, but a viÅ¿ible word. I call it a viÅ¿ible word, why? becauÅ¿e it conueyes the Å¿ignification of it, by the eye, to the minde; as this is an audible word, becauÅ¿e it conueyeth the Å¿ignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, by the eare to the minde.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:20181:18"/>
            <p>In the Sacrament, Å¿o often as yee looke on it, ye Å¿hall no Å¿ooner Å¿ee that Bread with your eye, but the body of ChriÅ¿t Å¿hal come into your mind; ye Å¿hal no Å¿ooner Å¿ee that Wine, but after the preaching, and opening vp of the parts of the Sacrament, the bloud of ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall come into your mind.</p>
            <p>Now, this coniunction, betweene the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Å¿tandeth chiefely, as yee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in two things. FirÅ¿t, in a relation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified; which ariÅ¿eth from a likenes, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt them two: for if there vvere no proportion, &amp; analogie betweene the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified by the Å¿igne, there could not be a Sacrament, or a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So the firÅ¿t part of this coniunction, Å¿tandeth in a relation, which ariÅ¿eth, from a certaine Å¿imilitude and likenes, which the one hath with the other. And this likenes may be eaÅ¿ily perceiued: for looke how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the bread is to nouriÅ¿h thy body to this life earthly &amp; temporall; the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t Å¿ignified by the bread, is as able to nouriÅ¿h both body &amp; Å¿oule to life euerlaÅ¿ting: Å¿o ye may perceiue Å¿ome kinde of proportion between the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:19"/>
            <p>The Å¿econd point of the coniunction, Å¿tandeth in a continuall &amp; mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the one with the other; in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, are offered both together, receiued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at one time, and in one action; the one, outwardly; the other, inwardly; if Å¿o bee that thou haÅ¿t a mouth in thy Å¿oule, which is faith, to receiue it. Then the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of the coniunction, Å¿tandeth in a ioynt offering, and in a ioynt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: and this I call a concurrence. Then, would you knowe what manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction is between the Å¿igne, &amp; the thing Å¿ignified? I Å¿ay, it is a relatiue coniunction; a Å¿ecret and a myÅ¿tical coniunction, which Å¿tandeth in a mutuall relation. There is no more to be obÅ¿erued heerein, but this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if yee conioyne theÅ¿e two, yee be carefull not to confound them: beware that ye turne not the one into the other, but keepe either of them, in his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, without confuÅ¿ion, or permixtion of the one, with the other; and Å¿o ye Å¿hall haue the lawfull coniunction, that Å¿hould be in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>There is not a leÅ¿Å¿on that can be learned out of this, at the leaÅ¿t that I can marke or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20181:19"/>gather, except only the leÅ¿Å¿on of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and goodnes of the euerliuing God, who hath inuented Å¿o many wonderfull Å¿orts of coniunction, and all to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, that wee might be conioyned to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance this great, &amp; myÅ¿ticall coniunction, betwixt the God of glory, and vs: In the which coniunction, our weale, felicity, and happineÅ¿Å¿e in this life, and in the life to come doth onely Å¿tand: That he is Å¿o care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to conioyne himÅ¿elfe, with his word and Sacraments; that we, in his word, and Sacraments, might be conioyned vvith him.</p>
            <p>If wee were mooued with the care, and loue of God, expreÅ¿Å¿ed in theÅ¿e coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though it were neuer Å¿o little on our parts, aÅ¿Å¿uredly, we would neuer defraude our Å¿elues, of the fruit of that happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, nor bring it in Å¿uch a loathing &amp; diÅ¿daine, as we doe this day: for we by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and preferring of our pleaÅ¿ures, to ChriÅ¿t &amp; his counÅ¿ell, haue made the Å¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks of our Å¿oules, Å¿o foule, and ill diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, that either they receiue him not at all; or if he be receiued, hee is not able to tary. And why? becauÅ¿e a foule Å¿tomack is not able to keepe him: for incontinent vvee
<pb facs="tcp:20181:20"/>choke him Å¿o, either with the luÅ¿ts of the fleÅ¿h, or with the cares of this world, that he is compelled to depart. And if ChriÅ¿t be not both deuoured, and digeÅ¿ted, hee can doe vs no good: and this digeÅ¿tion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, where there is not a greedy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, to the receit of him; for, if thou be not hungry for him, he is not ready for thee: And I am aÅ¿Å¿ured, if all the men in the Countrey were examined by this rule, that there were none that receiue ChriÅ¿t, but he that hath a Å¿tomack, and is hungry for him, I doubt that few Å¿hould be found to receiue him. I feare that vvee haue taken Å¿uch a lothing, and diÅ¿daine, of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly foode, that there is not Å¿uch a thing, as any kinde of hunger, or appetite of it in our Å¿oules. And vvhat is the cauÅ¿e of this? I will tell you: SuppoÅ¿e wee haue renounced the corporall and groÅ¿Å¿e Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, wherein our Fathers were plunged, and drowned, &amp; which men in Å¿ome parts, goe about to erect now: yet as the maners of this Countrey, and the behauiour of euery one of vs doth teÅ¿tifie, there is not a man that hath renounced that damnable Idoll, that hee hath in his ovvne Å¿oule; nor the inuiÅ¿ible Idolatry, that hee hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20181:20"/>in his owne hart and mind. There is not a man, but to that Å¿ame Idoll, wherewith hee was conceiued, &amp; borne, &amp; whereunto he addicted himÅ¿elfe, and was a Å¿laue before, but to that Idoll, he giueth his Å¿eruice yet. And therefore maruaile not, when thou haÅ¿t addicted thy Å¿eruice, Å¿et thy affection, and poured out thy hart, vpon that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of thine owne, vpon that Idoll of thine owne, vpon that luÅ¿t, and miÅ¿chiefe of thine owne, maruaile not if thou haue no appetite to ChriÅ¿t, nor to that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foode.</p>
            <p>When thou haÅ¿t thy Å¿oule poured forth on Å¿ome villanie, and vvickedneÅ¿Å¿e, and haÅ¿t Å¿ent it farre afield, how is it poÅ¿sible for thee to retire it, &amp; draw it home againe, to imploy it, where thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t, on ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us? Then, let euery one in his owne ranke, take heed to his owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meÅ¿tick Idoll, that lodgeth vvithin his owne hart, and preaÅ¿e to cleare himÅ¿elfe of it; or otherwiÅ¿e, yee cannot Å¿ee the face of ChriÅ¿t, nor be partakers of his kingdome.</p>
            <p>There is not another leÅ¿Å¿on in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tianitie but this: this is the firÅ¿t, &amp; the laÅ¿t leÅ¿Å¿on, to Å¿hake off your luÅ¿ts &amp; affections,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:21"/>peece and peece, and Å¿o by little and little renounce thy Å¿elfe, that thou maiÅ¿t em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ChriÅ¿t. I grant there is a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿e in this poynt, in Å¿ome, then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Å¿ome leÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿ome more profit in this: but, except in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, yee caÅ¿t off your Å¿elues, &amp; whatÅ¿oeuer in your own eyes yee account moÅ¿t precious, to come by ChriÅ¿t, yee are not worthy of him. And this is very hard to be done: It is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie for a man to Å¿peake it, to bid a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his owne Idol, which I call his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but it is not Å¿o Å¿oone done: aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, a Å¿tronger muÅ¿t come in, to caÅ¿t out the affections; yea, a Å¿tronger then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell muÅ¿t come in to driue out the diuell, who maketh reÅ¿idence in the affection, or elÅ¿e he will remaine there for euer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are not many, that haue renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themÅ¿elues; and examine thine heart when thou wilt, if there be any thing in the world, that thou loueÅ¿t better then ChriÅ¿t: If thou be not content to leaue father and mother, to leaue wife &amp; children, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer is deareÅ¿t vnto thee in this world, for ChriÅ¿t, thou art not worthy of him. If thou be not content to caÅ¿t off whatÅ¿oeuer maketh thee a Å¿tranger to ChriÅ¿t, thou art
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20181:21"/>not worthy of him. And is this a Å¿mall matter, Å¿eeing there is no part, or power of our Å¿oules, but it is enemy to this, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines againÅ¿t this heauenly coniunction? Is this an eaÅ¿ie thing, to caÅ¿t off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ourÅ¿elues, that wee may come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ChriÅ¿t? There is no greater thing then this; it hath not entred into euery hart, to conÅ¿ider of this; for this worke of our new creation, is tenne thouÅ¿and times greater, then the worke of our firÅ¿t creation: and therefore it is moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that euerie man take heede vnto himÅ¿elfe; for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is Å¿o crafty in this point, that hee erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euer, one I doll or other in our Å¿oules; and Å¿ometimes vnder the Å¿hew of vertue: which of all, is moÅ¿t dangerous. And in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery worke that wee take in hand, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Å¿o holy, hee is at our right hand, and maketh himÅ¿elf to haue intereÅ¿t in it: and hee contents himÅ¿elfe not with this, vnder the Å¿hew of vertue to corrupt vs, but hee is Å¿o watchfull, that euen in the beÅ¿t actions, and when yee are beÅ¿t occupied in your moÅ¿t vertuous actions, hee mixeth them with Å¿innes, and Å¿o doth all that lyeth in him, to make you loÅ¿e your profit, and loÅ¿e your rewards. For, when yee are beÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:20181:22"/>occupied, he goeth about to engender in you, an opinion of your Å¿elues, and Å¿o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraude God of his glory. Or otherwiÅ¿e, in dooing of good deedes, he maketh you Å¿o Å¿lack, and negligent, that if ye do them, ye doe them coldly, or Å¿o indiÅ¿creetly, that he makes you begin at the laÅ¿t, firÅ¿t, and makes it that Å¿hould be firÅ¿t, laÅ¿t; and Å¿o, as <hi>Martha</hi> was, to be occupied, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buÅ¿ie in thoÅ¿e things, which are not Å¿o ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary, as the things wherin <hi>Mary</hi> was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied: for, Å¿he Å¿hould haue preferred, firÅ¿t the hearing of the word, to the preparing of ChriÅ¿ts Supper. This is but to giue you an in-Å¿ight, and to let you Å¿ee, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is Å¿o craftie, that either he caÅ¿teth in, a falÅ¿e conceit of our Å¿elues, in dooing any good deed, or elÅ¿e, makes vs to doe that laÅ¿t, which Å¿hould be firÅ¿t; or then makes vs altogether Å¿o Å¿luggiÅ¿h, and Å¿o negligent, that wee do the worke of the Lord coldly: &amp; Å¿o, one way, or other, he holdeth vs euer in a continuall buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, Å¿o that we cannot be halfe watchful enough. For, we haue to do with principalities &amp; powers, with Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wickedneÅ¿Å¿es, which are aboue vs, and within vs alÅ¿o; for, there is not that man, that hath corruption within him, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is in him: we cannot therfore be halfe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20181:22"/>watchfull, or Å¿tudious enough, to caÅ¿t out the diuel, to renounce our Å¿elues, &amp; to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vs vnto the obedience of ChriÅ¿t. Thus farre concerning the coniunction.</p>
            <p>Now, Å¿eeing that the Å¿igne,
<note place="margin">How the Å¿igne, &amp; the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp; receiued. ConÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> &amp; the thing Å¿ignified, are diuerÅ¿e, it reÅ¿teth to be conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, how the Å¿igne is deliuered, and how the thing Å¿ignified is deliuered; and after what manner they are receiued. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning this, ye haue theÅ¿e things to marke. FirÅ¿t, to conÅ¿ider,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whether the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you, by one man, or not.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to conÅ¿ider, whether the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, be deliuered vnto you, in in one action, or not. Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vvhether both theÅ¿e things be giuen, by one inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or not. And fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ye are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider, whether the Å¿ign, &amp; the thing Å¿ignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be offered, &amp; receiued, after one maner, or not. Now, after that ye haue conÅ¿idered all theÅ¿e, in the end, yee Å¿hall find, that the Å¿igne, &amp; the thing Å¿ignified, are not giuen by one perÅ¿on. Yee Å¿hall finde next, that they are not giuen in one Å¿ort of action. Thirdly, yee Å¿hall finde, that they are not both offered, &amp; giuen by one inÅ¿trument. And fourthly, ye Å¿hal find, that they are not
<pb facs="tcp:20181:23"/>both giuen, and receiued, after one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. So, finding this diuerÅ¿itie, yee haue this to doe: marke the diuerÅ¿ity of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers and giuers: marke the diuerÅ¿itie of the actions: marke, thirdly, the diuerÅ¿itie of the inÅ¿truments: and fourthly, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿e manner of receiuing. Marke all theÅ¿e diligently, and ye Å¿hall finde little difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the Sacrament. And firÅ¿t to make it cleare vnto you, I Å¿ay, that the Å¿igne, &amp; the thing Å¿ignified by the Å¿igne, are not both giuen by one; and this ye Å¿ee plainly. For, as for the Å¿igne, that Bread, &amp; that Wine: yee Å¿ee your Å¿elues, that the MiniÅ¿ter offers vnto you the Å¿igne, he giues you that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; as that Å¿igne is an earthly, and corporall thing, Å¿o it is an earthly, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall man that giues it. Now, the thing Å¿ignified, is of another nature: for it is an heauenly and Å¿pirituall thing; therefore this heauenly thing, is not giuen by an earthly man; this incorruptible thing, is not giuen by a naturall and corruptible man. But ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us hath locked vp, and reÅ¿erued the miniÅ¿terie of this heauenlie thing, to himÅ¿elfe onely: therefore, there are two giuers in this Sacrament; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ter giueth the earthly thing; ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20181:23"/>the Mediator, giues you the heauenly thing in this Sacrament. For ChriÅ¿t, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the earthly thing, will not vÅ¿e his own miniÅ¿tery immediatly, nor the miniÅ¿terie of an Angell, but onely the miniÅ¿terie of an earthly man. And as for the diÅ¿penÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne body, and bloud, he will not giue it, either to heauenly creature, or earthly man; but he keepeth this miniÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to himÅ¿elfe, and he diÅ¿penÅ¿eth his own body and bloud, to whom, and when hee pleaÅ¿eth. And vvhy? If any man in the world, had power to giue ChriÅ¿tes body, and bloud, no queÅ¿tion, this man Å¿hould haue power to clenÅ¿e the hart and conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, hath this power with it; and conÅ¿equently, Å¿hould haue power to forgiue Å¿innes.</p>
            <p>Now, it is onely GOD that may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue Å¿innes; and therfore it is not poÅ¿sible, that the miniÅ¿tery of the heauenly thing, can be in the power of any man. Example we haue in <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.11. Saith he not, The miniÅ¿tery that I haue, is of the element; I am commaunded to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ter the element of water onely: but as for the miniÅ¿terie of the fire, and of the Å¿pirit, ChriÅ¿t hath reÅ¿erued it vnto himÅ¿elf.
<pb facs="tcp:20181:24"/>Therefore, looke not to get the Å¿pirit at mans hands, but at the hands of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe onely; and without this inward miniÅ¿tery, the outward miniÅ¿tery is not worth a Å¿traw. For, my outward miniÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, yea, Å¿uppoÅ¿e it were the miniÅ¿terie of an Angell, and Å¿uppoÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t were preÅ¿ent in the fleÅ¿h, to miniÅ¿ter vnto you theÅ¿e outward things, except hee conioyne the inward miniÅ¿terie of his Å¿pirit therewith, it availes nothing: it may well be as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿s againÅ¿t you, againÅ¿t the day of that generall aÅ¿Å¿embly; but to your Å¿aluation, it will neuer profit you. Therefore, this yee ought alwaies to pray for, that the Lord would water your harts, by his holy Å¿pirit, as he watereth your eares, by the hearing of his vvord. Then there are two offerers; the MiniÅ¿ter offers the Å¿igne, ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us offers himÅ¿elfe, the thing Å¿ignified. The three perÅ¿ons, one GOD, offers the Mediatour, or the Mediatour offers himÅ¿elfe, and that by the power, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his owne Spirit.</p>
            <p>As there are two offerers,
<note place="margin">The Å¿ign, &amp; the thing Å¿ignified, are offered in two actions, by two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments, &amp; after two manners.</note> two perÅ¿ons that offer, and giue the Sacrament, and thing Å¿ignified by the Sacrament: Å¿o theÅ¿e two, are offered, and giuen in two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20181:24"/>ChriÅ¿t, vvho is the heauenly thing, is offered, and giuen vnto you, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Å¿ecret, and Å¿pirituall action, which is not Å¿ubiect to the outward eye. The Å¿igne againe, is offered and giuen, in an outward action, after a corporall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible manner. As there are two Å¿orts of actions; Å¿o there are two Å¿orts of inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvhere-unto the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified are offered: for, the thing Å¿ingified, that is, ChriÅ¿t, is neuer offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the mouth of my body: the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, whole ChriÅ¿t, or the Å¿pirit of ChriÅ¿t, is not offered, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the word, nor in the Sacrament, to the mouth of my body. Let the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aries finde me that in any part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there is any other manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing ChriÅ¿t, then by faith, and let them haue the victorie. So there is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument, as I told you, neither hand, not mouth, to receiue ChriÅ¿t, but faith onely. As ChriÅ¿t, vvho is the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is receiued by the hand, &amp; mouth of faith: Å¿o the Å¿igne, which Å¿ignifieth ChriÅ¿t, is receiued by our ovvne naturall mouth, &amp; hand: ye haue a mouth in your heads, and in your bodies, as proper to receiue
<pb facs="tcp:20181:25"/>the Å¿igne, as faith is to receiue ChriÅ¿t. So the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, are offered and giuen, not to one inÅ¿trument, but to two; the one, to the mouth of the body; the other, to the mouth of the Å¿oule.</p>
            <p>Now, marke by what way theÅ¿e things are offered, and giuen, by the Å¿ame vvay, they are receiued: as the Å¿igne is corporal, and naturally offered to a corporall inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Å¿o is it receiued, after a corporall, &amp; naturall manner: for, thou muÅ¿t take the Bread, &amp; Wine, either by thy hand, or by thy mouth. The thing Å¿ignified, is not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> after a corporall manner, but after a Å¿ecret, and Å¿pirituall manner: and as it is offered, Å¿o it is taken. There can be nothing clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then this; the one is taken after a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall manner, the other after a Å¿ecret, &amp; Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner. So in this laÅ¿t part, ye haue theÅ¿e things to marke, to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the outward action, and the inward, between the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, and to keepe a proportion, and analogie between the inward, and the outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ye may Å¿urely perÅ¿wade your Å¿elues, that if ye be faithfull, ChriÅ¿t is as buÅ¿ie, working inwardly in your Å¿oules, as the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20181:25"/>MiniÅ¿ter is, working outwardly towards your bodies: looke how buÅ¿ie the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter is, in breaking that Bread, in pouring out that Wine, in giuing that Bread, and Wine, vnto thee, as buÅ¿ie is ChriÅ¿t, in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his owne body to thee, and in giuing thee iuyce of his owne body, after a Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and an inuiÅ¿ible manner. So keepe this diÅ¿tinction, and yee may aÅ¿Å¿ure your Å¿elues, that by faith, ChriÅ¿t is as well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied towards your Å¿oules, to nouriÅ¿h them, as the MiniÅ¿ter is outwardly towards your bodies. Keepe this, and yee haue the whole Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Then from this diÅ¿courÅ¿e and deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you may learn a double matter, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Sacrament conÅ¿iÅ¿teth. It Å¿tandeth on two Å¿orts of materials; that is, of an earthly matter, and of an heauenly matter: the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified. And as there is a double matter in the Sacrament: Å¿o the Sacrament muÅ¿t be handled after a double manner; by an outward action, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action: keep the diÅ¿tinction in theÅ¿e things, betweene the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, and ye Å¿hall not eaÅ¿ily Å¿lip in the vnderÅ¿tanding of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>This beeing Å¿aid, concerning the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:20181:26"/>conÅ¿ideration of the Elements (for all this yet appertaineth vnto the Elements) it reÅ¿teth that we Å¿peake Å¿ome-what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vvord,
<note place="margin">Of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is the word.</note> which I call the other part of the Sacrament. I meane &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand by the vvord, where-unto the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are annexed, that thing, vvhich quickneth this whole action, which Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, as it were a Å¿oule, and giueth life vnto the whole action. For, by the word, and appointment of ChriÅ¿t in the vvord, the MiniÅ¿ter knoweth vvhat is his part, the hearer knoweth what is his part, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one is prepared, how to deliuer, and how to receiue; the MiniÅ¿ter, how hee Å¿hould deliuer, and the hearer, how hee Å¿hold receiue. So the InÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, is the quickning of the whole action: for, all the action is warranted from the inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution Å¿et downe in his word. In the inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of ChriÅ¿t, there are two things chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conÅ¿idered: a Commaund: and a PromiÅ¿e. The Commaund is this, where he Å¿aith, <hi>Take, eate.</hi> The Commaund re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth obedience. There is a PromiÅ¿e alÅ¿o in the inÅ¿titution, and it is contained in theÅ¿e words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> The PromiÅ¿e craueth faith: as the Commaund craueth obedience; Å¿o the PromiÅ¿e craueth beliefe.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20181:26"/>Therefore come not vnto the Sacrament, except ye bring both faith and obedience with you. If thou come not with a heart minding to obey ChriÅ¿t, at the leaÅ¿t, more then thou waÅ¿t wont to doe, thou commeÅ¿t vnto thine ovvne damnation. And if thou bringeÅ¿t a hart voyd of faith, thou commeÅ¿t vnto thine owne damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So, let euery one that commeth vnto the Sacrament, bring with him a hart min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to doe better; that is, to obey, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue ChriÅ¿t, better then he did in time paÅ¿t. Except ye bring theÅ¿e two, in Å¿ome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure, come not vnto the Sacrament: for, whatÅ¿oeuer thou dooÅ¿t, except it flow from faith, it can profit nothing. Thus farre briefly concerning the word. Now it wil be demaunded, What need is there, that theÅ¿e Sacraments &amp; Å¿eales Å¿hould be annexed to the word? wherfore are they annexed, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we get no more in the Sacrament, then we get in the word, and wee get as much in the very Å¿imple word, as we get in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments? Seeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we get no new thing in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, but the Å¿ame thing which we get in the Å¿imple word, wherefore is the Sacrament appointed to be hung vnto the word? It is tru certainly, that we get no new
<pb facs="tcp:20181:27"/>thing in the Sacrament, nor wee get no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in the Sacrament, then we get in the word: for what more wouldeÅ¿t thou craue, then to get the Sonne of God, if thou get him well? Thy hart cannot wiÅ¿h, nor imagine a greater gift, then to haue the Sonne of God, who is King of heauen, and earth: therefore, I Å¿ay, VVhat new thing wouldeÅ¿t thou haue? for, if thou get him, thou getteÅ¿t all things with him; thy hart cannot imagine a new thing, beÅ¿ides him. Wherefore then is the Sacrament appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">AnÅ¿were. </seg>1</label> Not to get thee any new thing: I Å¿ay it is appointed, to gette thee that Å¿ame thing better,

That ChriÅ¿t might haue a larger Å¿pace, to make reÅ¿idence in our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row harts, then he could haue, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Å¿imple vvord; and to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e ChriÅ¿t more fully, it is a better thing. For, Å¿uppoÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t be one thing in himÅ¿elfe, yet the better hold thou haÅ¿t of him, thou art the Å¿urer of his promiÅ¿e.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:20181:27"/>
            <p>The Sacraments are appointed, that I might haue him more fully in my Å¿oule; that I might haue the boundes of it enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he may make the better reÅ¿idence in me. This, no doubt, is the cauÅ¿e where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theÅ¿e Seales are annexed, to the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Å¿imple word.</p>
            <p>They Å¿erue to this end alÅ¿o, to Å¿eale vp,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and confirme the truth that is in the word:
<note place="margin">They Å¿erue to confirme the truth contained in the vvord.</note> for as the office of the Seale hung to the Euidence, is not to confirme any other truth then that which is in the Euidence; and though ye belieued the Euidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet by the Å¿eales yee belieue it better: euen Å¿o the Sacraments aÅ¿Å¿ure me of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, then is contained vvithin the vvord: yet, becauÅ¿e it is a Å¿eale, annexed vnto the vvord, it perÅ¿wades me the better of the Å¿ame: for the more the outvvard Å¿enÅ¿es are wakened, the more is the inward hart and minde perÅ¿waded to belieue.</p>
            <p>Now the Sacrament wakeneth all the outward Å¿enÅ¿es, as the eye, the hand, and all the reÅ¿t: and the outward Å¿enÅ¿es beeing mooued, no queÅ¿tion, the Å¿pirit of GOD concurring there-with, moues the hart the more. The Sacraments are then annexed vnto the vvord, to Å¿eale vp the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb facs="tcp:20181:28"/>in the word, and to confirm it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The word then is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to worke beliefe: and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is appointed to confirme you in this beliefe. But except yee feele the truth of this, inwardly in your harts; except yee haue your harts as ready as your mouth, thinke not that any thing will auaile you. All the Å¿eales in the world wil not work, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Å¿pirit of God concur, and Å¿eale the Å¿ame truth in your harts, which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Å¿eales outwardly: Except hee make cleere the Å¿ight of thy minde inwardly, and worke a feeling in thy hart, both word, and Sacrament Å¿hall loÅ¿e their fruite and effect which they Å¿hould haue. All the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are full of this: the whole Scriptures of God, are but a Å¿laying letter to you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Å¿pirit of God concurre, to quicken inwardly.
<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Therefore your whole indeuour Å¿hould be, to preaÅ¿e to feele ChriÅ¿t inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your harts, that finding him in your harts, and Å¿eeing him in your minds, both word, and Sacraments may be effectuall: If not, your Å¿oules remaine dead, ye are not tranÅ¿lated from that death, wherin ye were conceiued. Therefore all the Å¿tudy of ChriÅ¿tians Å¿hould be, when they Å¿ee the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20181:28"/>and heare the word, to labor to finde, and feele in their harts and mindes, that which they heare, and Å¿ee; and this I call to finde ChriÅ¿t quick in your ovvne Å¿oules. This cannot be, except yee Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his lodging: for if all the corners of thy Å¿oule remaine a dunghill, ChriÅ¿t cannot dwell there: and therefore, except ye Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for continuall growth in Å¿anctification, &amp; Å¿euer your Å¿elues from euery thing, that Å¿euers you from ChriÅ¿t, it is not poÅ¿sible that hee can liue or dwell in you.</p>
            <p>This is a great leÅ¿Å¿on, and it is not poÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe this, except, as I haue Å¿aid, a Å¿tronger come in, &amp; poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e vs, and make vs to renounce our Å¿elues. Then the Å¿eales had not been annexed to the word, except for our cauÅ¿e: for, there is no neceÅ¿sity on Gods part, that God Å¿hould either Å¿weare, or confirme by Å¿eales, the thing that hee hath Å¿poken: for, his word is as good, as any oath or Å¿eale. But the neceÅ¿Å¿ity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of vs: there is Å¿uch a great weakneÅ¿Å¿e in vs, that vvhen hee hath Å¿worne, and Å¿et his Å¿eales vnto his vvord, wee are as neere to belieue, as if hee had neuer Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a vvord. So to helpe our beliefe, our vveakeneÅ¿Å¿e, and inabilitie that is in vs,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:29"/>for we are Å¿o vnable by nature, that we can belieue nothing, but that which is of our Å¿elues; and the more wee leane vnto our Å¿elues, the further we are from God. I Å¿ay to helpe this wonderfull weakenes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are ready to miÅ¿truÅ¿t God in euery word, he hath annexed his Sacraments; &amp; beÅ¿ides his Sacraments, hee Å¿weares the things that concerne moÅ¿t our Å¿aluation. As in the PrieÅ¿thood of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 110.4. He will not Å¿peake onely, but he Å¿weares, and that for our weakenes and infirmities: but yet if he abÅ¿tract the miniÅ¿tery of his Å¿pirit, all theÅ¿e meanes will do no good.</p>
            <p>Now, the laÅ¿t thing is, how the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is peruerted;
<note place="margin">Faults w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> peruert the Sacrament.</note> and how we are defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the fruit, and effect thereof. Two Å¿orts of faults peruert the Sacrament, and defraude vs of the profit, and vÅ¿e thereof: and theÅ¿e faults are either in the forme, or in the perÅ¿on. In forme, if the eÅ¿Å¿entiall forme be Å¿poyled, we gette nothing<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> for when the Sacrament is Å¿poyled of the eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entiall forme, it is not a Sacrament. There is an eÅ¿Å¿entiall forme in BaptiÅ¿me, and an eÅ¿Å¿entiall form in the Lords Supper, which if they be taken away, ye loÅ¿e the vÅ¿e of the Sacrament. The eÅ¿Å¿entiall forme of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20181:29"/>is: <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy GhoÅ¿t:</hi> leaue out any of theÅ¿e three, or doe it in the name of any one of the three perÅ¿ons one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye loÅ¿e the eÅ¿Å¿entiall form of BaptiÅ¿me. In the Lords Supper, if yee leaue out the leaÅ¿t ceremonie, ye loÅ¿e the eÅ¿Å¿ential form, and Å¿o it is not a Sacrament. I Å¿peak of the eÅ¿Å¿entiall forme, in reÅ¿pect of the PapiÅ¿ts, who keepe the eÅ¿Å¿entiall forme in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, though they haue brought in trifles of their owne, and mixt with it; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect they keepe the Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall forme, it is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that they, who were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized vnder them, be rebaptized. Indeed, if the vertue of regeneration, flowed from the perÅ¿on, it were Å¿omething; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect ChriÅ¿t hath this, to giue to whom, &amp; when he pleaÅ¿eth, the eÅ¿Å¿entiall forme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept, it is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be reiterated.</p>
            <p>Now, what are the faults in the perÅ¿on that peruerts the Sacrament? The fault may be either in the perÅ¿on of the giuer, or in the perÅ¿on of the receiuer (I Å¿peake not of thoÅ¿e common faults, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, but of Å¿uch faultes, as diÅ¿able the perÅ¿on of the giuer, to be a diÅ¿tributer
<pb facs="tcp:20181:30"/>of the Sacrament, &amp; taketh the office from him) Å¿o when the perÅ¿on of the giuer is this way diÅ¿abled, no queÅ¿tion, it is not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then again in the perÅ¿on of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, the faults may be, if their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> be not in the couenant, but out of it, they get not the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. Indeed, if the Parents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward com to the couenant, the children (thogh they be gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> out of the couenant) may be receiued. Euen Å¿o in the L. Supper; if a man be laden with any burthen of Å¿in, without any purpoÅ¿e to repent, hee ought not to receiue it. So then, if ye come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a purpoÅ¿e to repent, ye loÅ¿e the vÅ¿e of the Sacrament: it is onely this purpoÅ¿e to repent, that maketh me, who receiue the Sacrament, to get the fruit &amp; effect therof; therefore euery one, who goeth to that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, muÅ¿t looke what purpoÅ¿e he hath in his hart. HaÅ¿t thou a purpoÅ¿e to murder, to continue in adultery, or to commit any other vile Å¿in that is in thy hart, and art not reÅ¿olued to repent? In Å¿hewing thee to be without repentance, thou Å¿heweÅ¿t thy Å¿elfe to be without faith, and conÅ¿equently thou commeÅ¿t vnto thy condemnation, &amp; not to thy Å¿aluation: take heed then what your purpoÅ¿e is; for if with a diÅ¿Å¿olute life, yee

            <p>I had thought to haue entred particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into the handling of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

               </gap>ffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Å¿o gracious a God. If ye be able, as that woman was, by the tears of a contrite hart, to waÅ¿h the feete of ChriÅ¿t, humbly to kiÅ¿s his feete, and to get hold of the foote of ChriÅ¿t; though yee dare not preÅ¿ume Å¿o high, as to get him whole, ye are in a good caÅ¿e: but if thou want all theÅ¿e, and haÅ¿t them not in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, thou wanteÅ¿t all the degrees of preparation; therefore, let none come to this Table, except hee haue theÅ¿e in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure. But vvhere there is a diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure for Å¿inne, a purpoÅ¿e to doe better, &amp; an earneÅ¿t Å¿obbing, and Å¿ighing, to get the thing that thou wanteÅ¿t; in that Å¿oule, where God hath placed this deÅ¿ire of ChriÅ¿t, it is the vvorke of Gods

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though that Å¿oule be farre from the thing that it Å¿hould be at, let him not refuÅ¿e to goe to the Lords Table; but let him go with a profeÅ¿sion of his owne infirmitie &amp; weakeneÅ¿Å¿e, and with a deÅ¿ire of the thing that he wants.

            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">FirÅ¿t head generall.</note> we finde Å¿undry names giuen vnto the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in the booke of God; and euery name carries a Å¿peciall reaÅ¿on with it.
<note place="margin">Of the names giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vnto this Sacrament, both in the Bible, and by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> Wee finde this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, called the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t. This name is giuen vnto it, no doubt, becauÅ¿e it is a heauenly, &amp; Å¿piritual nouriture; it containes a nouriture of the Å¿oule, that is able to nouriÅ¿h, and traine vp the Å¿oule, to a life Å¿piritual, to that life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laÅ¿ting: for this cauÅ¿e it is called the body, &amp; bloud of ChriÅ¿t. It is called alÅ¿o the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, to put a difference betwixt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20181:32"/>it, &amp; a profane Å¿upper: for this is the Lords Supper, a holy Å¿upper; not a profane, or common Å¿upper: a Å¿upper, appointed for the increaÅ¿e of holineÅ¿s, for the food of the Å¿oule in holineÅ¿s, to feede the Å¿oule vnto life euerlaÅ¿ting. Not a Å¿upper appointed for the belly; for he had ended that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that was appointed for the belly, or euer he began this Å¿upper, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Å¿oule. A Å¿upper, no doubt, hauing reÅ¿pect to the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿tance of time, by reaÅ¿on it was inÅ¿tituted, in the article of that time, when they vÅ¿ed to Å¿uppe. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alÅ¿o in the Bible, The Table of the Lord. It is not called the Altar of the Lord: but the ApoÅ¿tle calleth it a Table, to Å¿it at; and not an Altar, to Å¿tand at: a Table, to take, and receiue at; &amp; not an Altar, to offer at. It is called alÅ¿o, the Communion, and participation of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t: we haue theÅ¿e names giuen vnto it, beÅ¿ide Å¿ome others, in the Scriptures of God. The Ancients of the Latine, &amp; of the Greeke Churches, gaue it Å¿undry names, for Å¿undry reÅ¿pects. They called it, a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique action; and this vvas a very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name. Some-times they called it a ThankÅ¿giuing. Some-times they called it
<pb facs="tcp:20181:33"/>a banquet of loue; and Å¿ometimes they gaue it one name, and Å¿ometimes another. And at the laÅ¿t, in the declining eÅ¿tate of the Latine Church, &amp; in the falling eÅ¿tate of the Romane Church, this Sacrament began to be peruerted; and with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, there came in a peruerÅ¿e name, and they called it the <hi>MaÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> They trouble themÅ¿elues much, concerning the deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this name: Å¿ometime they Å¿eeke it from an Hebrew original; Å¿ometime from a Greeke; and Å¿ometime from a Latine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall: but it is plaine, that the vvord is deriued from the Latine; and it is a word which might haue been tollerable, when it was firÅ¿t inÅ¿tituted: for, no doubt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, at the firÅ¿t inÅ¿titution of this word, was not then wholly peruerted; but now, in proceÅ¿Å¿e of time, corruption hath preuatied Å¿o farre, that it hath turned the Sacrament into a Å¿acrifice; and where we Å¿hould take from the hand of GOD, in ChriÅ¿t, they make vs to giue.</p>
            <p>This is plaine Idolatry: and therefore, vvhereas the vvord vvas tollerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now it ought not to be tollerable any way, it ought not to be Å¿uffered. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if wee had eaten, and drunke, as oft
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20181:33"/>the body &amp; bloud of ChriÅ¿t in our Å¿oules, as wee haue eaten that bread, and drunke that wine, which are the Å¿ignes of his body and bloud, we would not haue Å¿uffered this word of the <hi>MaÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> much leÅ¿Å¿e the very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, to be Å¿o riÅ¿e in this Countrey: But becauÅ¿e we haue but played the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaits, and defrauded our Å¿oules of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t, and tooke one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the outward Sacrament; therefore it is that our zeale decayeth; therfore it is, that our knowledge, and light decayeth: and for want of zeale, loue, and knowledge, the word of the <hi>MaÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> is becom cuÅ¿tomable vnto you, and not onely the word, but the very action. I will not runne out heerin: I onely tell you, what commeth of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buÅ¿e of the hearing of the vvord, vvhat iudgements follow vpon the abuÅ¿e of the receiuing of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d head generall. Of the ends why this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was inÅ¿tituted.</note> I come to the ends wherefore the Sacrament was appointed. This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inÅ¿tituted in the Å¿ignes of Bread, and Wine; and was appointed chiefely for this end, to repreÅ¿ent our Å¿pirituall nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the full and perfect nouriture of our Å¿oules: that as he who hath Bread &amp; Wine, lacketh nothing for the full nouriÅ¿hment
<pb facs="tcp:20181:34"/>of his body: Å¿o hee, or that Å¿oule vvhich hath the participation of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t, wanteth nothing for the full and perfect nouriÅ¿hment of the Å¿oule. To repreÅ¿ent this full and perfect nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Å¿ignes of bread and vvine in the Sacrament, were Å¿et downe and inÅ¿tituted. The Å¿econd end,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wherfore this Sacrament was inÅ¿tituted, is this; That we might teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the world, and to the Princes of the world, who are enemies to our profeÅ¿sion; that we might openly avow, and teÅ¿tifie vnto them our Religion, and our manner of worÅ¿hipping, in the which we avow, and worÅ¿hip ChriÅ¿t: and that wee might alÅ¿o teÅ¿tifie our loue towards his members, our bretheren: this is the Å¿econd end vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was inÅ¿tituted.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third end, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was inÅ¿tituted, is this; to Å¿erue for our Å¿peciall comfort, and conÅ¿olation; to Å¿erue as a Å¿oueraine medicine, for all our Å¿pirituall diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, as wee finde our Å¿elues, either readie to fall, or prouoked to fall, by the diuell, the fleÅ¿h, or the world; or after that we haue fallen, and are put to flight by the diuell, and would faine flee away from God; GOD of his mercie, and of his infinite pitie, and bottomleÅ¿Å¿e
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20181:34"/>compaÅ¿sion, hath Å¿et vp this Sacrament, as a Å¿igne on an high hill, whereby it may be Å¿eene on euery Å¿ide, farre, and neere, to call all them againe, that haue run Å¿hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully away: and hee clucks to them, as a Henne doth to her chickens, to gather them vnder the wings of his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The fourth end, vvherefore this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was inÅ¿tituted, is this, that in this action, wee might thanke him for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, and render to him hartie thanks, that he hath come downe Å¿o familiarly to vs, bowed the heauens, as it were and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs the body and bloud of his owne Sonne, that wee might render vnto him harty thanks, and Å¿o Å¿anctifie his benefits vnto vs: for this thankÅ¿giuing, this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was alÅ¿o inÅ¿tituted. Thus far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ends briefely.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">Third head generall.</note> I come to the things contayned in this Sacrament. Yee Å¿ee with your eyes, there are corporall things, viÅ¿ible things, as the Bread, and Wine. There are againe hid from the eye of your body, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent to the eye of your minde, Å¿pirituall things, heauenly, and invvard things: both theÅ¿e are in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The corporal, viÅ¿ible, &amp; outward things,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:35"/>are the things which are appointed,
<note place="margin">Of the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Å¿undry heads are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.</note> to Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Å¿pirituall, heauenly, and inward things. And why? Nothing without a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on. TheÅ¿e corporall Å¿ignes, are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Å¿ignifie the Å¿pirituall things, becauÅ¿e we are corporall, we are earthly bodies, we haue our Å¿oule lodging within a carnal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in a tabernacle of clay, a groÅ¿Å¿e taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which cannot be wakened, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, except by the things that are like to it Å¿elfe. It cannot be induced to the conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of heauenly things, except by groÅ¿s, temporall, and corporall things. If we had been of the nature of the thing Å¿ignified, that as the thing Å¿ignified, is Å¿pirituall, and heauenly; Å¿o wee had been Å¿pirituall, and heauenly, we had not needed a corporall thing: Å¿o, if the thing Å¿ignified, had been as wee are, corporall, earthly, and viÅ¿ible, we had not needed a Å¿igne, to lead vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider of it: But becauÅ¿e the thing Å¿ignified, is Å¿pirituall, and we are corporall, therfore to bring vs vnto the Å¿ight of theÅ¿e Å¿pirituall things, he vÅ¿eth a corporall means, and an outward Å¿igne. This is the reaÅ¿on, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theÅ¿e corporall Å¿ignes, are appointed to Å¿ignifie the Å¿pirituall thing.</p>
            <p>The Å¿pirituall thing in both the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20181:35"/>is one, and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame, ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, Å¿ignified in both the Sacraments: yet in diuerÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, he is the thing Å¿ignified in BaptiÅ¿me, and hee is the thing Å¿ignified in the Lords Supper. This ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, in his bloud chiefely, is the thing Å¿ignified in the Sacrament of BaptiÅ¿me: and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e, that by his bloud, hee waÅ¿heth away the filth of our Å¿oules; becauÅ¿e, that by the vertue of his bloud, he quickneth vs in our Å¿oules, with a heauenly life: becauÅ¿e, that by the power of his bloud, hee ingrafteth, and incorporateth vs, in his owne body. For, that Sacrament, is a teÅ¿timonie of the remiÅ¿sion of our Å¿innes: that is, of the cleaneneÅ¿Å¿e of our conÅ¿ciences, that our conÅ¿ciences, by that bloud, are waÅ¿hed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. It teÅ¿tifieth alÅ¿o, our new birth, that wee are begotten Å¿piritually, to a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly life. It teÅ¿tifieth alÅ¿o, the ioyning of vs in the body of ChriÅ¿t. As it is a teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Å¿o it is a Å¿eale: it not onely teÅ¿tifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but Å¿ealeth it vp in our harts, and maketh vs in our harts, to feele the taÅ¿te of that heauenly life begun in vs, that wee are tranÅ¿lated from death, in the which wee were conceiued, and ingrafted in the body of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:36"/>
            <p>Marke then: ChriÅ¿t, in his bloud, as hee is the waÅ¿hing of our regeneration, is the thing Å¿ignified in BaptiÅ¿me. In this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, againe, this Å¿ame ChriÅ¿t is the thing Å¿ignified, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reÅ¿pect; to wit, in this reÅ¿pect, that his body and bloud, Å¿erue to nouriÅ¿h my Å¿oule to life euerlaÅ¿ting: for this Sacrament, is no other thing, but the image of our Å¿pirituall nouriÅ¿hment; GOD teÅ¿tifying how our foules are fed, &amp; nouriÅ¿hed to that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, by the image of a corporal nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. So in diuerÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, the Å¿ame thing, that is, Chr. IeÅ¿us, is Å¿ignified in BaptiÅ¿me, and is Å¿ignified in the Lords Supper. In this Sacrament, the fruits of ChriÅ¿tes death, whereof I Å¿pake, the vertue of his Å¿acrifice, the vertue of his paÅ¿sion, I call not theÅ¿e fruits &amp; vertues only, the thing Å¿ignified in the Sacrament of the L Supper: but rather I call the thing Å¿ignified, that Å¿ubÅ¿tance, &amp; that perÅ¿on, out of the which Å¿ubÅ¿tance, this vertue, &amp; theÅ¿e fruits do flow, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. I grant, and it is moÅ¿t certain, that by the lawfull vÅ¿e, &amp; participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, thou art partaker of all theÅ¿e fruites: yet theÅ¿e fruites, are not the firÅ¿t, and chiefe thing, whereof thou art parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20181:36"/>in this Sacrament; but of force, thou muÅ¿t get another thing firÅ¿t. It is true, that no man can be partaker of the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of ChriÅ¿t, but the Å¿ame Å¿oule, muÅ¿t be alÅ¿o partaker of the fruites that flowe from his Å¿ubÅ¿tance: yet notwithÅ¿tanding, thou muÅ¿t diÅ¿cerne betwixt the Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and the fruites that flowe from the Å¿ubÅ¿tance; and thou muÅ¿t be partaker of the Å¿ubÅ¿tance in the firÅ¿t roome; then in the next place, thou muÅ¿t bee partaker of the fruites that flowe from his Å¿ubÅ¿tance. To make this cleere; in BaptiÅ¿me, the fruites of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, are remiÅ¿sion of our Å¿innes, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the killing of Å¿inne, and the Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp of our adoption, to life euerlaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Å¿ubÅ¿tance out of the which theÅ¿e fruite, doe flowe, is the bloud of ChriÅ¿t. Ye muÅ¿t heere, of force, diÅ¿cerne between the bloud, vvhich is the Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes, waÅ¿hing, and regeneration, which are the fruites, that flow from this bloud: Å¿o in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the fruits of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, are, the growth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> faith, &amp; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿e in holineÅ¿s. The thing Å¿ignified, is, the Å¿ubÅ¿tance; that is, the body &amp; bloud of ChriÅ¿t is the Å¿ubÅ¿tance, out of which, this
<pb facs="tcp:20181:37"/>growth in faith, and holineÅ¿Å¿e, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Now, Å¿ee ye not this; That you muÅ¿t diÅ¿cerne betweene the Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and the fruites, and muÅ¿t place the Å¿ubÅ¿tance in the firÅ¿t place? So that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of ChriÅ¿t, that is, ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, is the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this Sacrament. For your owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will make this plaine vnto you: Before your Å¿tomack be filled with any foode, yee muÅ¿t eate the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the food firÅ¿t; before you be filled with bread, yee muÅ¿t eate the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the bread firÅ¿t; before your drouth bee quenched with any drinke, yee muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿sitie, drinke the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the drinke firÅ¿t: Euen Å¿o, after this maner; before the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of your Å¿oules be Å¿atisfied &amp; the thirÅ¿t thereof quenched, yee muÅ¿t eate the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, and drinke his bloud firÅ¿t, and that by faith. So, conÅ¿ider the one by the other; looke to what vÅ¿e bread and vvine Å¿erue to thy body, to the Å¿ame vÅ¿e, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of ChriÅ¿t Å¿erue to thy Å¿oule; and he that appointed the one to Å¿erue for thy body, the Å¿ame God appointed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to Å¿erue for thy Å¿oule. So, looke how impoÅ¿sible it is for thee, to be fedde with that foode that neuer commeth into thy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20181:37"/>mouth, or to recouer health, by thoÅ¿e drugges which neuer were applyed; it is as impoÅ¿sible, for thee to be fed by the body of ChriÅ¿t, &amp; to get thy health by the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, except thou firÅ¿t eate his bodie, and drinke his bloud. Then yee Å¿ee, that the thing Å¿ignified in the Lords Supper, is not the fruites, Å¿o much as the body, and bloud, and ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and Å¿ubÅ¿tance, from which theÅ¿e fruites doe flowe, and proceed.</p>
            <p>Then I Å¿ay, Å¿uppoÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t,
<note place="margin">The thing Å¿ignified in both the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts, is one: the Å¿ignes are not one.</note> who is the thing Å¿ignified, remaine alwaies one, and the Å¿ame, in both the Sacraments: yet the Å¿ignes, whereby this one ChriÅ¿t is Å¿ignified in the Sacraments, are not one, nor of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>quall number. For in BaptiÅ¿me, the thing that repreÅ¿enteth ChriÅ¿t, is Water. In the Lords Supper, the things that repreÅ¿ent ChriÅ¿t, are Bread, and Wine. Water is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to repreÅ¿ent ChriÅ¿t in BaptiÅ¿me, becauÅ¿e it is meeteÅ¿t to repreÅ¿ent our vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing with the bloud of ChriÅ¿t: for, what is fitter to waÅ¿h with, then water? Å¿o there is nothing meeter to waÅ¿h the Å¿oule, then the bloud of ChriÅ¿t. In this Sacrament he hath appointed Bread, and Wine: why? BecauÅ¿e there is nothing more meet to
<pb facs="tcp:20181:38"/>nouriÅ¿h the body, then bread and vvine, Å¿o the Lord hath not choÅ¿en theÅ¿e Å¿ignes without a reaÅ¿on. As the Å¿ignes in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament are not alwaies one; Å¿o the Å¿ame in both, are not of one number: for, in BaptiÅ¿me, wee haue but one element; in this Sacrament, wee haue two elements. Now, what is the reaÅ¿on of this diuerÅ¿itie, that the Lord in the one Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Why in BaptiÅ¿me there is but one Å¿igne, and in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per two.</note> hath appointed two Å¿ignes, and in the other but one Å¿igne? I will Å¿hew you the reaÅ¿on. He hath appointed onely one Å¿igne in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, to wit, Water; becauÅ¿e Water is Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient enough for the whole. If Water had not been Å¿ufficient, to repreÅ¿ent the thing Å¿ignified, hee would haue appointed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿igne: but in reÅ¿pect that water do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap> the turne, and repreÅ¿enteth fully the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing of our Å¿oules, by the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, what need then haue we of any other Å¿ign? Now, in this Sacrament, one Å¿igne will not Å¿uffice, but there muÅ¿t be two. And vvhy? Wine cannot be Å¿ufficient alone; neyther can Bread be Å¿ufficient alone: for, he that hath Bread onely, and Wine onely, hath not a perfect corporall nouriÅ¿hment; therefore, that they might repreÅ¿ent, and let vs Å¿ee a perfect nouriÅ¿hment, hee hath
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20181:38"/>giuen vs both Bread &amp; Wine (for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect corporall nouriÅ¿hment, Å¿tandeth in meat and drinke) to repreÅ¿ent the full and perfect nouriÅ¿hment of the Å¿oule. Marke how full, and perfect a nouriÅ¿hment hee hath to his body, that hath Å¿tore of Bread and Wine: So he that hath ChriÅ¿t, lacketh nothing of a full, and perfect nouriÅ¿hment for his Å¿oule. Then you Å¿ee the reaÅ¿on, wherfore there are two Å¿ignes appointed in this Sacrament, and onely one Å¿igne in BaptiÅ¿me.</p>
            <p>There remaineth yet, concerning theÅ¿e Å¿ignes, two things to be inquired. FirÅ¿t,
<note place="margin">Two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tions: What pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the bread hath to be a Å¿igne in this Sacrament: And how long that power indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</note> what power hath that bread in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be a Å¿igne, more then the bread, which is vÅ¿ed in common houÅ¿es: from whence commeth that power? Next, if it haue a power, how long indureth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that power, with the bread? For the firÅ¿t, concerning the power which that bread hath, more then any other bread: I will tell you.</p>
            <p>That bread hath a power giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vnto it by ChriÅ¿t, &amp; by his inÅ¿titutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>;
<label type="milestone">

               <pb facs="tcp:20181:39"/>ChriÅ¿t,
<note place="margin">That bread hath that power from ChriÅ¿ts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution.</note> and his inÅ¿titution, vvhich other common bread hath not: Å¿o that if any of you would ask, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the MiniÅ¿ter, in this action, is breaking, or diÅ¿tributing that Bread, pouring out, and diÅ¿tributing that Wine; if you would, I Å¿ay, aske, what Å¿ort of creatures thoÅ¿e are? this is the anÅ¿were: They are holy things. Yee muÅ¿t giue this name, to the Å¿ignes, and Å¿eales of the body and bloud of ChriÅ¿t. That bread of the Sacrament, is a holy bread; and that vvine, is an holy vvine: Why? BecauÅ¿e the bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, hath Å¿euerd them from that vÅ¿e wherevnto they Å¿erued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and hath applied them vnto an holy vÅ¿e; not to feed the body, but to feede the Å¿oule.</p>
            <p>Thus farre concerning the power of that bread: it hath a power flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ChriÅ¿t, and his inÅ¿titution.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">AnÅ¿wer. </seg>2</label> Now, the Å¿econd thing is, how long this power continueth vvith that bread; how long that bread hath this office.
<note place="margin">That power continues during the Å¿eruice of the Table.</note> In a word, I Å¿ay, this power conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth with that bread, during the time of the action; during the Å¿eruice of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Look how long that action continues, and that the Å¿eruice of the Table laÅ¿teth, Å¿o long it continueth holy bread; Å¿o long
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20181:39"/>continueth the power with that bread: but, looke how Å¿oone the action is ended, Å¿o Å¿oone endeth the holineÅ¿Å¿e of it: looke how Å¿oon the Å¿eruice of the Table is ended; Å¿o Å¿oon that bread, becomes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon bread againe, &amp; the holineÅ¿Å¿e of it, ceaÅ¿eth. Then this power continueth not for euer, but it continues onely, during the time of the action, and Å¿eruice of the Table. Thus far concerning the Elements.</p>
            <p>There is beÅ¿ides the Elements, an other Å¿ort of Å¿ignes in the Sacrament: there is not a ceremonie in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, but is a Å¿igne, and hath it owne Å¿pirituall Å¿ignification with it: as namely, looking to the breaking of that bread, it repreÅ¿enteth vnto thee, the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the body, &amp; bloud of ChriÅ¿t. Not, that his body, and bones were broken, but that it was broken with dolour, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿h, and diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e of hart; with the weight of the indignation, and furie of God, that he Å¿uÅ¿tained for our Å¿innes, which he took vpon him. Then, the breaking, is an eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entiall ceremonie: the pouring out of the wine alÅ¿o, is an eÅ¿Å¿entiall ceremonie. For, as yee Å¿ee cleerly, that by the wine is Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the bloud of ChriÅ¿t; Å¿o, by the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:20181:40"/>out of the wine, is Å¿ignified, that his bloud was Å¿euered from his fleÅ¿h; and the Å¿euering of thoÅ¿e two, maketh death: for, in bloud is the life; and conÅ¿equently, it teÅ¿tifieth his death. The pouring out of the wine, then, tells thee, that he dyed for thee, that his bloud was Å¿hed for thee; Å¿o this is an eÅ¿Å¿entiall ceremonie, which muÅ¿t not be left out. LikewiÅ¿e, the diÅ¿tribution, giuing, and eating of that bread, are eÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ceremonies. And what doth the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting teÅ¿tifie vnto thee? The applying of the body &amp; bloud of ChriÅ¿t vnto thy Å¿oule. So that there is none of theÅ¿e rites, but haue their own Å¿ignification; and there cannot one of them be left out, but ye Å¿hal peruert the whole action. Thus farre concerning the Å¿ignes.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">An obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> what profit can ye make of all this diÅ¿courÅ¿e? Learne this leÅ¿Å¿on, and yee Å¿hal make profit by theÅ¿e things. In reÅ¿pect that euery Å¿igne and ceremonie, hath it owne Å¿pirituall Å¿ignification, Å¿o that there is not a ceremonie in this whole action, that wants it owne Å¿pirituall Å¿ignification; conÅ¿ider this, and thinke with your Å¿elues, at that time eÅ¿pecially when yee are at the Lords Table, &amp; in the Å¿ight of that action,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20181:40"/>that looke vvhat thou Å¿eeÅ¿t the MiniÅ¿ter dooing outwardly, what euer it be: (Is he breaking that Bread? is hee dealing that bread? is he pouring out, and diÅ¿tributing that vvine?) Thinke aÅ¿Å¿uredly vvith thy Å¿elfe, that ChriÅ¿t is as buÅ¿ie, dooing all theÅ¿e things, Å¿piritually vnto thy Å¿oule: hee is as buÅ¿ie, giuing vnto thee, his ovvne bodie, vvith his owne hand: hee is as buÅ¿ie, giuing to thee his owne bloud, with the vertue, and efficacie of it. So, in this action (if thou be a faithfull Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant) looke vvhat the mouth doth, and hovv the mouth of the body is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied outwardlie: Å¿o is the hand, and mouth of the Å¿oule (vvhich is faith) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied invvardly. As the mouth taketh that Bread, and that Wine; Å¿o the mouth of thy Å¿oule, taketh the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t, and that by faith. For by faith, and a conÅ¿tant perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, is the onelie vvay to eate the bodie, and drinke the bloud of ChriÅ¿t invvardly: and dooing this, there cannot but follow a fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eating. Thus farre, for the conÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Å¿ignes.</p>
            <p>Now commeth in the matter wherein greateÅ¿t difficulty Å¿tandeth, wherof I Å¿pake
<pb facs="tcp:20181:41"/>the laÅ¿t day,
<note place="margin">How the Å¿ignes, and the thing Å¿ignified, are conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Sacrament.</note> as God gaue me the grace; yet in the particular, I muÅ¿t Å¿peak, as wel as in the generall, but Å¿omewhat more Å¿hortly. Then ye haue to vnderÅ¿tand, for the better information of your conÅ¿ciences; and for the better preparation of your Å¿oules, yee haue to vnderÅ¿tand, how that bread, and that vvine, which are the Å¿ignes, are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t, which are Å¿ignified thereby: What Å¿ort of coniunction this is, and from whence this coniunction floweth, I Å¿hall be briefe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e I haue already, in my laÅ¿t Lecture, Å¿poken of it at large.</p>
            <p>Take heede: for if ye giue not good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, it is not poÅ¿sible, that ye can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this coniunction. Concerning this coniunction, would you knowe how theÅ¿e two are coupled? Then muÅ¿t you firÅ¿t marke the nature of the Å¿ignes, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing Å¿ignified; yee muÅ¿t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue both their natures: And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e nothing can be coupled, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with other, but Å¿o farre, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it will Å¿uffer; if the nature of it will not Å¿uffer a coniunction, they cannot be conioyned: or, will the nature of it Å¿uffer a coniunction? looke how farre it will Å¿uffer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20181:41"/>a coniunction, Å¿o farre are they conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Seeing then ye muÅ¿t obÅ¿erue the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things that are conioyned, firÅ¿t marke the thing Å¿ignified, what the nature thereof is; marking that, ye Å¿hall Å¿ee, that the thing Å¿ignified, is of a Å¿pirituall nature; of a heauenly, and myÅ¿ticall nature: then may ye conclude, that this Å¿piritual thing, will Å¿uffer a Å¿pirituall coniunction, a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall, and Å¿ecret coniunction.</p>
            <p>Againe, obÅ¿erue the Å¿igne: The Å¿igne, of his nature (as I haue told you) hath a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto the thing Å¿ignified; &amp; the thing Å¿ignified, of his nature, hath a relation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Å¿igne. So then the Å¿igne, &amp; the thing Å¿ignified, will Å¿uffer to be conioyned, by a mutuall relation: both the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, in reÅ¿pect they haue a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall relation, the one vnto the other, they will Å¿uffer themÅ¿elues to be conioyned by a relatiue coniunction. Now if ye ask me, what Å¿ort of coniunction, is betweene that bread, and that wine, and the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t: To tell you in a word, I Å¿ay, it is a Å¿ecret, and Å¿pirituall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Å¿uch a coniunction, as Å¿tandeth in a mutuall reÅ¿pect, betwixt the bread, and the body of ChriÅ¿t, and betwixt the wine, and
<pb facs="tcp:20181:42"/>the bloud of ChriÅ¿t: then I Å¿ay, it is a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, &amp; a Å¿pirituall coniunction. Ye would not be Å¿o inquiÅ¿itiue of this coniunction, if it were corporall, viÅ¿ible, or locall: if you Å¿aw them both before your eyes, you would not aske how they are conioyned; or if thou didÅ¿t Å¿ee them both in one place. But, becauÅ¿e you Å¿ee but the one with your eyes, and the other is hid, this maketh the coniunction the more difficult to be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and vnderÅ¿tood. And how is it poÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ye can conceiue this Å¿ecret, and hid coniunction, except you haue the eyes of your minde illuminated by the Å¿pirit, whereby ye may come to the right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding? But if yee haue any inÅ¿ight into theÅ¿e Å¿pirituall matters that come by faith, this coniunction will appeare as cleerely, by the eye of your faith, as the phyÅ¿icall coniunction dooth, to the eye of your body.</p>
            <p>Novv, to haue this matter made more plain; there is another coniunction, which Å¿erueth to make this coniunction very cleere: namely, the coniunction betwixt the vvord, which I Å¿peake, and the thing Å¿ignified by that Å¿ame word. As if I Å¿peake to you, of things in this language, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20181:42"/>yee vnderÅ¿tand, bee it of things paÅ¿t, though neuer Å¿o long Å¿ince; of things to come, though neuer Å¿o far off; of things abÅ¿ent, though neuer Å¿o farre diÅ¿tant; yet Å¿o Å¿oone as I Å¿peake the vvord, vvhether it be of things paÅ¿t, or to come, the thing it Å¿elfe will come into your minde. The vvord is heard no Å¿ooner by your eare, but the thing Å¿ignified by the Å¿ame vvord, commeth into your minde. What maketh the thing Å¿ignified, though abÅ¿ent, to come into my mind? This could not be, except there were a coniunction, betweene the word, and the thing Å¿ignified by the word.</p>
            <p>As for example; If I Å¿peak of the King, who is now a great way diÅ¿tant from vs (I pray God bleÅ¿Å¿e him) yee will no Å¿ooner heare the word, but the King, vvho is the thing Å¿ignified by the word, will come into your minde. If I Å¿peake of things paÅ¿t, though they be already expired, yet the thing Å¿ignified, vvill preÅ¿ently come into your minde: Å¿o there is a coniunction yee Å¿ee, between the word, and the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the word. Marke this coniunction, and yee Å¿hall gette the nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, and coupling of the Å¿igne, which is the thing Å¿ignified in the Sacrament.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:43"/>
            <p>For obÅ¿erue, what Å¿ort of coniunction is between the vvord, and the thing Å¿ignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the word, the Å¿ame Å¿ort of coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is between the Sacrament, which is Å¿eene to the eye of your body, &amp; the thing Å¿ignified by the Sacrament, which is Å¿eene to the eye of your Å¿oule onely. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; Å¿o Å¿oone as thou Å¿eeÅ¿t that bread, taken in the hand of the MiniÅ¿ter, thou Å¿eeÅ¿t it not Å¿o Å¿oone, but incontinent, the body of ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t come into thy mind; theÅ¿e two are Å¿o conioyned, that they com both together: the one, to the outward Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es; the other, to the inward Å¿enÅ¿es. This is not enough now, becauÅ¿e in the inÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ye are commanded to goe further; &amp; not onely to looke to that bread, and that wine, but to take that bread, and that wine: incontinent, as your hand takes the one, Å¿o your hart takes the other; as your teeth eates the one, Å¿o the teeth of your Å¿oule, which is faith, eates the other; that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth ChriÅ¿t vnto your Å¿oule. So yee Å¿ee there is a coniunction heere, Å¿ecret, and myÅ¿ticall: and therefore, ChriÅ¿t cannot be conioyned, but by a Å¿ecret, and myÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call coniunction. The coniunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ChriÅ¿t, and vs, is a Å¿ecret, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20181:43"/>coniunction; which the ApoÅ¿tle, in the fift of the <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> calleth that Å¿pirituall coniunction, ful of an high myÅ¿terie: this coniunction cannot be taken vp at the firÅ¿t. So, Å¿eeing the coniunction is Å¿ecret, and Å¿pirituall, and not perceiued, but by the Å¿pirit of God; all is as nothing, except ye haue Å¿ome portion, and meaÅ¿ure of his Å¿pirit. All that is taught in the word, and Sacraments, will neuer doe you good, will neuer carry your Å¿oules to heauen, except the Å¿pirit of God illuminate your mindes, and make you to finde in your Å¿oules, the thing that ye hear in the word. Then learn this, Å¿eeing the word ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not be vnderÅ¿tood, but by the Å¿pirit of GOD, craue that the Lord would illuminate the eyes of your mindes, by his Å¿pirit; and be you as careful to get the Å¿pirit, as yee are carefull now in the hearing of the word. Thus farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the coniunction.</p>
            <p>Now ye haue heard, how the Å¿igne is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with the thing Å¿ignified, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for you to knowe? This reÅ¿ts yet to knowe, how the Å¿igne is receiued,
<note place="margin">How the Å¿igne, &amp; the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</note> and how the thing Å¿ignified is receiued; vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee both receiued with one mouth, or not; whether the Å¿igne, and the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:44"/>thing Å¿ignified, be receiued after one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hion, and manner, or not. And marking the diuerÅ¿e manner of receiuing, and the diuerÅ¿ity of the inÅ¿truments, yee Å¿hall not eaÅ¿ily erre in the Sacrament. The Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, are receiued by two mouthes: for ye Å¿ee the Å¿ignes, that is, that bread, and wine, wherunto they are giuen; they are giuen to the mouth of the body. Then the mouth of the body, is the inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that receiueth that bread, and that vvine, which are the Å¿ignes. As that bread, and that wine, are viÅ¿ible, and corporall: Å¿o the mouth, and inÅ¿trument, whereby they are receiued, is viÅ¿ible, and corporall. The thing Å¿ignified by the bread, and wine, is not receiued by the mouth of the body: no, the Scripture denieth that plainly, but it is receiued by the mouth of the Å¿oule. Then there are two mouthes: that bread, and that wine, which are the Å¿ignes, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the mouth of the body: ChriÅ¿t, vvho is the thing Å¿ignified, is receiued by the mouth of the Å¿oule; that is, by a true faith.</p>
            <p>Then, bring not to the Lords Table, one mouth onely (for, if yee bring the mouth of your body onely, it auaileth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20181:44"/>nothing) but bring with you alÅ¿o, the mouth of your Å¿oule, a conÅ¿tant perÅ¿waÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the death of ChriÅ¿t, for that is availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Novv, concerning the manner hovv the Å¿ignes are receiued, and the manner how the thing Å¿ignified is receiued; yee may eaÅ¿ily knowe, that theÅ¿e corporall, &amp; naturall Å¿ignes, muÅ¿t be receiued after a corporall, and naturall maner: they muÅ¿t be taken with the hand, or mouth of the body. Againe, a Å¿upernaturall thing, muÅ¿t be receiued after a Å¿upernaturall manner: A Å¿pirituall thing, muÅ¿t be receiued, after a Å¿pirituall manner. So, as the Å¿ignes are corporall, and receiued after a corporall manner, with the hand, or the mouth of the body; In like manner, the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is Å¿pirituall, and receiued after a Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manner, with the hand and mouth of the Å¿oule, which is true faith. Thus yee haue briefely deliuered vnto you, the whole preparation, that is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the vnderÅ¿tanding of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now, what doctrine gather I from this? Of this laÅ¿t point, vvhere I Å¿ay, that ChriÅ¿t is the thing Å¿ignified, and cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but by faith, cannot be receiued,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:45"/>nor digeÅ¿ted, but by a faithfull Å¿oule: what kinde of receiuing confirme I in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? I eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h no kind of receiuing of ChriÅ¿t,
<note place="margin">What kinde of receiuing ChriÅ¿t, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tabliÅ¿hed in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> but a Å¿piritual receiuing: he can not be perceiued, nor receiued, but by faith, and faith is Å¿pirituall: Therefore in this Sacrament, I eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h onely a Å¿piritual taking of ChriÅ¿t; &amp; not a carnall, or fleÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiuing. This is the ground: Novv let vs Å¿ee, what inconuenience can follow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground.
<note place="margin">Inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences caÅ¿t in by the PapiÅ¿ts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Å¿pirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of ChriÅ¿t in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The PapiÅ¿ts Å¿ay, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, this inconuenience Å¿hall follow. If there be no receiuing of ChriÅ¿t, but a Å¿pirituall receiuing, then (Å¿ay they) your Sacrament is in vaine; this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, was inÅ¿tituted to no end. And what is their reaÅ¿on? If there be no way to receiue ChriÅ¿t (Å¿ay the PapiÅ¿ts) but by faith, what need you then a Sacrament? Yee receiue ChriÅ¿t, by faith, in the word: by the naked and Å¿imple prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, ye get faith. So the Å¿im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple word, may Å¿erue the turne. What need haue ye of a Sacrament, if ye get not Å¿ome new thing in the Sacrament, which yee could not get in the word?</p>
            <p>This is their Argument; whereof ye Å¿ee their concluÅ¿ion to be this: Wee get no
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20181:45"/>other new thing in the Sacrament,

            <p>VVee admit the Antecedent to bee true: vvee get no other thing, nor no new thing in the Sacrament, but the Å¿ame thing which we got in the word. I would haue thee deuiÅ¿e, and imagine vvith thy Å¿elfe, what new thing thou vvouldeÅ¿t haue: let the hart of man, deuiÅ¿e, imagine, and wiÅ¿h, he durÅ¿t neuer haue thought to haue Å¿uch a thing, as the Sonne of GOD; hee durÅ¿t neuer haue preÅ¿umed, to haue pearced the clowdes, to haue aÅ¿cended Å¿o high, as to haue craued the Sonne of GOD in his fleÅ¿h, to be the foode of his Å¿oule. Hauing the Sonne of God, thou haÅ¿t him, who is the heire of all things; who is King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and earth; and in him, thou haÅ¿t all things. What more then canÅ¿t thou wiÅ¿h? What better thing canÅ¿t thou wiÅ¿h? Hee is equall with the Father, one in Å¿ubÅ¿tance with the Father, true GOD, &amp; true man, vvhat more canÅ¿t thou wiÅ¿h? Then, I Å¿ay, vvee get no other thing in the Sacrament, then wee had in the vvord: content thee vvith this. But Å¿uppoÅ¿e it be Å¿o; yet the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:46"/>Sacrament is not Å¿uperfluous. But woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿t thou vnderÅ¿tand what new thing thou obtaineÅ¿t? what other thing thou getteÅ¿t? I will tell thee.
<note place="margin">Refutation of the firÅ¿t Inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> SuppoÅ¿e thou get that Å¿ame thing which thou haddeÅ¿t in the vvord, yet thou getteÅ¿t that Å¿ame thing better. What is that <hi>better?</hi> Thou obtaineÅ¿t a greater, and Å¿urer hold of that Å¿ame thing in the Sacrament, then thou hadÅ¿t by the hearing of the vvord. That Å¿ame thing, which thou poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿edÅ¿t, by the hearing of the word, thou dooÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e now more largely; it hath larger bounds in thy Å¿oule, by the receiuing of the Sacrament, then other-wiÅ¿e it could haue, by the hearing of the word onely. Then wilt thou aske what new thing wee get? I Å¿ay, wee get this new thing: we get ChriÅ¿t, better then before; we get the thing which we had, more fully: that is, with a Å¿urer apprehenÅ¿ion then we had it before; we gette a greater hold of ChriÅ¿t now. For, by the Sacrament, my faith is nouriÅ¿hed, the boundes of my Å¿oule are enlarged: and Å¿o, whereas I had but a little hold of ChriÅ¿t before, as it were betweene my finger, and my thumbe, now I get him in my whole hand; and Å¿till the more that my faith groweth, the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20181:46"/>better hold I get of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us. So the Sacrament is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and if it were no more but to get ChriÅ¿t better, and to get a faÅ¿ter apprehenÅ¿ion of him, by the Sacrament, then vvee could haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Now, if it were true, that the Sacrament is Å¿uperfluous: by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on it Å¿hold follow alÅ¿o, that the repetition of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is Å¿uperfluous. For, when yee come to the Sacrament the Å¿econd time, ye get no other thing then yee did the firÅ¿t time: vvhen ye come vnto the Sacrament the third time, yet get no other thing then yee did the firÅ¿t time: and yet no man will Å¿ay, that the third, and Å¿econd comming, is a Å¿uperfluous thing. And vvhy? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e by the Å¿econd comming, my faith is augmented, I vnderÅ¿tand better, I growe in knowledge, I growe in apprehenÅ¿ion, I grow in feeling: and in getting the growth of all theÅ¿e, as oft as I come, there is no man will Å¿ay, that the oft comming to the Sacrament is Å¿uperfluous, &amp; if it were eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day once. So, their firÅ¿t inconuenience auailes not: Wee get no new thing in the Sacrament; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sacrament is Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:47"/>
            <p>Thus farre for the firÅ¿t. Then there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends another thing on the Å¿ame ground. If ChriÅ¿t be not perceiued, but by faith; then, Å¿ay we, no wicked body can perceiue him; hee that lacketh faith, cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. He that lacketh faith, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Sacrament, of that bread, and that vvine, and may eate of that bread, and drinke of that wine; but hee that vvanteth faith, may not eate &amp; drink of the body &amp; bloud of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿ignified by that bread, &amp; by that wine. So this is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d: no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e people can perceiue ChriÅ¿t, nor eate the body of ChriÅ¿t in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>AgainÅ¿t this ground, they bring their Argument out of the Å¿ame words of the ApoÅ¿tle, which I haue read; the words are theÅ¿e; <hi>Hee that eateth of this Bread, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorthily</hi> (Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle) <hi>and drinketh of this Cuppe vnworthily, is guilty of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of ChriÅ¿t.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is their ground:
<note place="margin">Second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>uenience.</note> So that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will Å¿uffer this forme: <hi>No man can be guiltie of that thing, vvhich hee hath not receiued: they haue not receiued the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t: therefore, they cannot be guiltie of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t: but Å¿o it is, that the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, they are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20181:47"/>guilty, therefore they haue receiued the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anÅ¿were vnto the PropoÅ¿ition,
<note place="margin">Refutation of the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, wher in are Å¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaÅ¿ons giuen, why the wicked are counted guilty of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t.</note> and I Å¿ay, it is very falÅ¿e: They could not bee guiltie of that body, and bloud, except they had receiued it; for they may be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Å¿ame body, &amp; of that Å¿ame bloud, Å¿uppoÅ¿e they neuer receiued it. But marke the Text: The Text Å¿aith not, that they eate the body of ChriÅ¿t vnworthily; but it Å¿aith, that they eate that bread, and drinke that wine vnworthily: And yet, becauÅ¿e they eate that bread, and drinke that wine vnworthily, they are counted before God, guiltie of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t. Now wherefore is this? Not becauÅ¿e they receiue him; for, if they receiued him, they could not but receiue him vvorthily, for ChriÅ¿t cannot be receiued of any man, but woorthily: but they are accounted guiltie of the body and bloud of the Son of GOD, becauÅ¿e they refuÅ¿ed him. For vvhen they did eate that Bread, and drink that wine, they might, if they had had faith, haue eaten and drunke the fleÅ¿h, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t leÅ¿us. Now, becauÅ¿e thou refuÅ¿eÅ¿t the body of ChriÅ¿t, offered to thee, thou contemneÅ¿t his body, offered vnto
<pb facs="tcp:20181:48"/>thee, if thou haue not an eye to diÅ¿cerne, and indge of this body, that is offered. For if they had had faith they might haue Å¿een his body, offered with the bread; by faith they might haue taken that Å¿ame body, &amp; by faith, they might haue eaten that Å¿ame body. Therefore, lacking their wedding garment, wanting faith, whereby they Å¿hould eate the bodie, and drink the bloud of ChriÅ¿t; wanting faith, which is the eye of the Å¿oule, to perceiue, and the mouth of the Å¿oule, to receiue that body, which is Å¿pirituallie offered; they are counted guiltie of that Å¿ame body &amp; bloud.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs make this more cleere by a Å¿imilitude. Ye Å¿ee among worldly Princes, their cuÅ¿tome is, not to Å¿uffer their maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tie to be impeached in the Å¿malleÅ¿t thing that they haue. VVhat meaner thing is there that concerneth the maieÅ¿tie of a Prince, then a Å¿eale? for the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of it is but wax: yet, if thou diÅ¿dainfullie vÅ¿e that Å¿eale, and contemne it, and Å¿tampe it vnder thy feet, thou Å¿halt be eÅ¿teemed as guilty of his body, and bloud, as hee that laid violent hands on him, &amp; thou Å¿halt be puniÅ¿hed accordingly. Much more, if thou come as a Å¿wine, or as a dog, to handle the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20181:48"/>Å¿eales of the bodie, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t; much more maieÅ¿t thou bee rockoned guilty of his body, and of his bloud.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of the eating of the body of ChriÅ¿t: The vvicked cannot eate the bodie of ChriÅ¿t; but they may bee guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it. The ApoÅ¿tle maketh this more plaine yet, by another Å¿peech, vvhich I haue Å¿ometimes handled out of this place. In <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.6. it is Å¿aid, that <hi>ApoÅ¿tates,</hi> they that fall away, they crucifie the Son of God againe; and their falling away, maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as guilty, as they were who crucified him. He is now in heauen, they cannot fetch him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> thence, to crucify him: yet the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, they crucifie him. Why? BecauÅ¿e their malice is as great, as theirs that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, becauÅ¿e they match in malice, with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that crucified him; Å¿o that if they had him on the earth, they vvould doe the like: therefore they are Å¿aid to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Sonne of GOD. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. there is another Å¿peech: the wicked are Å¿aid to Å¿tampe the bloud of ChriÅ¿t vnder their feet. Why? BecauÅ¿e their malice is as great, as theirs that Å¿tamped his bloud.</p>
            <p>Now, they are accounted for this reaÅ¿on, to be guiltie of the bodie and bloud of
<pb facs="tcp:20181:49"/>ChriÅ¿t, not becauÅ¿e they eate his body, but becauÅ¿e they refuÅ¿ed it, vvhen they might haue had it.</p>
            <p>Now, the time remaines yet, wherein we may haue the body,
<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and bloud of ChriÅ¿t. This time is very precious, and the diÅ¿pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation of times is very Å¿ecret, and hath it owne bounds: if yee take not this time now, it will away. This time of Grace, and of that heauenly foode, hath been diÅ¿pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed vnto you very long: but how ye haue profited, your liues and behauiours teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Remember therefore your Å¿elues in time, and in time make vÅ¿e of it; for yee knowe not how long it will laÅ¿t: craue a mouth to receiue, as well the food of your Å¿oules, that is offered, as ye doe the food of your bodies: and take this time while yee may haue it, or aÅ¿Å¿uredly the time Å¿hall come, when yee Å¿hall cry for it, but Å¿hall not get it; but in place of Grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Å¿hall come iudgement, vengeance, &amp; the diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of vvrath.</p>
            <p>They will not leaue this matter Å¿o; but they inÅ¿iÅ¿t yet, and they bring more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to prooue, that the vvicked are partakers of the bodie,
<note place="margin">Third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>uenience.</note> and bloud of ChriÅ¿t; <hi>That Bread</hi> (Å¿ay they) <hi>yee vvill
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20181:49"/>grant, vvhich the vvicked man eates, is not naked bread, but is that bread vvhich is the Sacrament.</hi> Thus then they make their Argument; <hi>The Sacrament hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conioyned vvith it, the thing Å¿ignified: But the Sacrament is giuen to all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thing Å¿ignified is giuen to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if I grant to them all this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<note place="margin">Refutation of the third inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> There Å¿hould no inconuenience follow. For, the thing Å¿ignified may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all; that is, offered to all, as it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to all men, and yet not receiued of all. Giuen to all; therefore receiued of all, it followeth not. I may offer you tvvo things; yet it is in your owne will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will take them, or no, but ye may take the one, and refuÅ¿e the other: and yet hee that offers, offered you the thing that ye refuÅ¿ed, as truely, as the thing which ye tooke. So, GOD deceiueth no man: but with the word, and Sacraments, aÅ¿Å¿uredly hee giueth two things, if they would take them. By his vvord, hee offers the word to the eare, hee offers ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us to the Å¿oule. By his Sacraments, hee offers the Sacraments to the eye, hee offers ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us to the Å¿oule.</p>
            <p>Now, it may be, that where two things
<pb facs="tcp:20181:50"/>are truly, &amp; conioyntlie offred, a man may receiue the one, and refuÅ¿e the other. Hee receiueth the one, becauÅ¿e he hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument to take it: he refuÅ¿eth the other, becauÅ¿e he wanteth an inÅ¿trument. I heare the word, becauÅ¿e I haue an eare to heare it with: I receiue the Sacrament, becauÅ¿e I haue a mouth to receiue it with: but as for the thing, which the word, and Sacraments repreÅ¿ent, I may refuÅ¿e it; becauÅ¿e I haue not a mouth to take it, nor an eye to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it: and therefore, the fault is not on Gods part, but on our part. The wicked get the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t offered to them conioyntly, with the word, &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the fault is on their part, that they haue not a mouth to receiue him, and God is not bound to giue them a mouth. Mark this: That if it were not of Gods Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace, and mercie, that he giueth mee an eye to perceiue him, and a mouth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him; I would refuÅ¿e him, as well as they. So, this Argument holdeth not: <hi>ChriÅ¿t is offered to all; Ergo, hee is receiued of all.</hi> Happy were they, if they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. Thus far for the 3. Argument.</p>
            <p>What reÅ¿teth now for the ful vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Sacrament? TheÅ¿e things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20181:50"/>That we vnderÅ¿tand the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Å¿peeches, that are vÅ¿ed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for, we vÅ¿e to Å¿peake of them: God vÅ¿eth to Å¿peake of them: and the Ancients vÅ¿e to Å¿peake of them. Wee vÅ¿e to Å¿ay, that the Å¿oule eateth the body of ChriÅ¿t, and drinketh the bloud of ChriÅ¿t.
<note place="margin">How the Å¿oule is Å¿aid to eate the body, and drinke the bloud of ChriÅ¿t.</note> TheÅ¿e Å¿pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wold be opened to you, how the Å¿oule is Å¿aid to eate the body, &amp; drink the bloud of ChriÅ¿t: theÅ¿e Å¿peeches are Sacramental; yet yee are not the wiÅ¿er: but I will make it plaine, by Gods grace. They are Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall; what is that? Ye knowe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the bodie to eate and drink, they are the proper actions of the body only. Now they are aÅ¿cribed to the Å¿oule by a tranÅ¿lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by a figuratiue maner of Å¿peaking. That which is proper to the body, is aÅ¿cribed to the Å¿oule, and it is Å¿aid that the Å¿oule eateth &amp; drinketh. The eating of the Å¿oule, doth reÅ¿emble the eating of the bodie: then the eating of the Å¿oule, is no other thing, but the applying of ChriÅ¿t to the Å¿oule; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that he hath Å¿hed his bloud for mee; that he hath purchaÅ¿ed remiÅ¿sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of Å¿ins for me. Wherfore then cal you this an eating? what call you the eating of the body? They body eateth, when thou applieÅ¿t the meat
<pb facs="tcp:20181:51"/>to thy mouth. If then the eating of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be no other thing, but the applying of meat to the mouth; the eating of the Å¿oule is no other thing, but the applying of the nouriÅ¿hment to the Å¿oule. Then yee Å¿ee what is meant by the eating and drinking of the Å¿oule: no other thing, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of ChriÅ¿t to my Å¿oule, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of his death &amp; paÅ¿sion to my Å¿oule; and this is onely done by faith: therefore he that lacketh faith, cannot eate ChriÅ¿t. Thus farre for the eating and drinking of the Å¿oule, vvhich are Sacramentall Å¿pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>There remaineth now, of all theÅ¿e great things,
<note place="margin">ObÅ¿erua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and of all this doctrine which hath bin taught, but this one leÅ¿Å¿on: That thou learne to apply ChriÅ¿t rightly to thy Å¿oule. Thou art a great Diuine, if thou haÅ¿t lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this wel: for, in the right applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of ChriÅ¿t, to the Å¿ick Å¿oule, to the wounded conÅ¿cience, and diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed heart, heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes the fountaine of all our felicitie, &amp; the wel-Å¿pring of all our ioy. And I wil tell you, what this application worketh: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue, what the preÅ¿ence of thy Å¿oule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee (Å¿uppoÅ¿e thou want ChriÅ¿t in thy Å¿oule) doth to this earthly body, to this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20181:51"/>lump of clay; as by the preÅ¿ence of the Å¿oule, it liueth, it mooueth, it feeleth: as the Å¿oule giueth to the body, life, mouing, and Å¿enÅ¿es: that Å¿ame very thing, dooth ChriÅ¿t vnto thy Å¿oule. HaÅ¿t thou once laid hold of, and applyed him to thee? As the Å¿oule quickens thy body, Å¿o hee quickens thy Å¿oule; not with an earthly, or temporal life, but with the life which hee liueth in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>: he makes thee to liue that Å¿ame life, which the Angels liue in heauen: hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thee to moue, not with worldly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but with heauenly, Å¿pirituall, &amp; cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tiall motions. Againe, he inÅ¿pires in thee, not outward Å¿enÅ¿es, but heauenly Å¿enÅ¿es; he worketh in thee, a Å¿piritual feeling, that in thine own hart &amp; conÅ¿cience, thou mayÅ¿t find the effect of this word. So, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of ChriÅ¿t with my Å¿oule, I get a thouÅ¿and times greater benefits, then the body doth by the Å¿oule: for the bodie, by the preÅ¿ence of the Å¿oule, getteth onely an earthly &amp; temporall life, Å¿ubiect to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual miÅ¿ery: but by the preÅ¿ence of ChriÅ¿t in my Å¿oule, I Å¿ee a bleÅ¿Å¿ed life, I feele a bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed life: &amp; that Å¿ame life, takes daily more &amp; more increaÅ¿e in me. Then the ground of all our perfection, &amp; bleÅ¿Å¿ednes, Å¿tandeth
<pb facs="tcp:20181:52"/>in this coniunction: &amp; Å¿uppoÅ¿e thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t liue <hi>MethuÅ¿helaes</hi> yeeres, and wert euer Å¿eking; yet if in the laÅ¿t houre, thou get this coniunction, thou maiÅ¿t thinke thy trauel well beÅ¿towed; thou haÅ¿t gotten enough: for if we haue obtained ChriÅ¿t, wee haue gotten all with him. Then the applying of ChriÅ¿t to my Å¿oule, is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>taine of all my ioy &amp; felicitie. Now, let vs Å¿ee how we get this coniunction. This is a Å¿pirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, a coniunction hard, &amp; difficult to be purchaÅ¿ed, obtained, &amp; gotten of vs, How then is this coniunction brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout? which are the means of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>iunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Gods part? &amp; which are the means on our part to get ChriÅ¿t, to put ChriÅ¿t in our Å¿oules, &amp; to make ChriÅ¿t one with vs? There is one means on Gods part, that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs vnto ChriÅ¿t, &amp; there is another on our part. On Gods part, there is the holie Å¿pirit, which offereth the body, &amp; bloud of Chr. to vs: and on our part, there muÅ¿t be a means, or elÅ¿e, though he offer, we will not receiue. Therefore of neceÅ¿sity, there muÅ¿t be faith in our Å¿oules, to receiue that which the holy Å¿pirit offers, to receiue that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food, of the body &amp; bloud of Chr. which Å¿he holy Å¿pirit offers. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> faith, &amp; the holy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20181:52"/>Å¿pirit, are the two means of this Å¿piritual, &amp; heauenly coniunction. By theÅ¿e 2. means, by faith, &amp; by the holy Å¿pirit, I get the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chr. the body of Chr. is mine, &amp; he is giuen to my Å¿oule. Now, heer comes in the queÅ¿tion; How canÅ¿t thou Å¿ay, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ChriÅ¿t is giuen, or deliuered to thee, Å¿eeing the body of ChriÅ¿t is Å¿itting at the right hand of God the Father? &amp; look how great diÅ¿tance is betwixt heauen and earth, as great diÅ¿tance is there, betwixt the body of ChriÅ¿t, and thy body: how then Å¿ay yee, that the body of ChriÅ¿t is giuen to you? The PapiÅ¿ts vnderÅ¿tand not this; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they imagin a groÅ¿s &amp; carnal coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Except the Å¿pirit of God reueale theÅ¿e things, they cannot be vnderÅ¿tood. The Å¿pirit of God muÅ¿t illuminate our mindes, and be planted in all our harts, before wee can come to the vnderÅ¿tanding of this. Then wouldeÅ¿t thou vnderÅ¿tand hovv ChriÅ¿t is giuen thee? This ground is true, that the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, is at the right hand of the Father; the bloud of ChriÅ¿t is at the right hand of the Father: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding, though there be as great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance betwixt my body, and the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, as is betwixt heauen and earth,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:53"/>yet ChriÅ¿tes body is giuen to me, becauÅ¿e I haue a title to his body giuen to mee: the right, and title which is giuen to me, of his body, and bloud, makes me to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e his body and bloud. The diÅ¿tance of the place, hurteth not my title, nor my right: for if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, haue a peece of Land lying in the fartheÅ¿t part of England, if ye haue a good title to it, the diÅ¿tance of the place cannot hurt your title: Å¿o I Å¿ay, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of place, hurts not my title, and my right, that I haue to ChriÅ¿t. But, though he be Å¿itting at the right hand of the Father, yet the title, and right, that I haue to him, makes him mine; Å¿o that I may Å¿ay trulie, this ChriÅ¿t is my property. Then ChriÅ¿t is not made mine, becauÅ¿e I fetch him out of the heauens: but he is mine, becauÅ¿e I haue a Å¿ure title, &amp; right to him; &amp; hauing a Å¿ure title, and iuÅ¿t right to him, the diÅ¿tance of place, how farre Å¿oeuer it be, can no wayes hurt my title, nor right; but where-euer he be, he is mine, becauÅ¿e I haue a right &amp; ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to him. Yea, not onely haue I a title to him, but this title is confirmed to mee: For, as I gette a title to him in the vvord (and if I got not that title to him in the word, I durÅ¿t not come to the Sacrament)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20181:53"/>Å¿o in the Sacrament, I get the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my title, I get the Seale, which confirmes my title. Then to come to the point, ChriÅ¿ts bodie, is Å¿itting at the right hand of the Father, and yet he is mine, and is deliuered to me, becauÅ¿e I haue right to his bodie, be it where it will: hee was borne for mee, giuen to mee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to mee: So diÅ¿tance of place, hurts not the Å¿uretie of my title, as propinquitie of place, helpes not the Å¿uretie of the Å¿ame. Though ChriÅ¿t would bow the heauens, and touch thee with his bodie, as he did <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi> yet this could not helpe thee, for if thou haÅ¿t not a title to him, thou dareÅ¿t not call him, thine. So it is not the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, nor proximity of place, that makes ChriÅ¿t mine: It is onely the right, that I haue to him: I haue right to him, only by faith: So by faith only, Chr. is made mine. But they thinke, they haue gotten a great vantage of vs, if we be Å¿o farre from Chr. as the heauen is, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the earth; but this Å¿hal be anÅ¿wered, by Gods grace: I haue a title to his body, his body is diÅ¿tant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> my body: yet his body is not diÅ¿tant from me, that is, from my Å¿oule, I Å¿ay his bodie and my Å¿oule are conioyned. It is a Å¿trange ladder,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:54"/>that will reach from the earth to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, yet let me tell you, there is a corde that extendeth from the earth to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens;
<note place="margin">Faith is that which couples vs and ChriÅ¿t.</note> and coupleth mee and ChriÅ¿t toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this is onely true fayth: By true faith, ChriÅ¿t, though he be in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, is coupled, and conioyned with me, who am heere on earth: I will Å¿hewe you this by a Å¿imilitude.
<note place="margin">Similitude taken from the Å¿unne.</note> Is not the bodie of the Å¿unne in the firmament? It is imposÅ¿ible for you, to touch the bodie of the Å¿un, yet the bodie of the Å¿unne, and yee are conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, How? By thoÅ¿e beames that Å¿hine on you; by that light, that Å¿hineth vpon you: Why may not the bodie of ChriÅ¿t then, though it be in the heauens, be conioyned with mee, that am on the earth, namelie, by the beames, by the light, and gladnes, that floweth from his bodie? My bodie, &amp; ChriÅ¿ts body are conioined, by the vertue, and power, flowing from his bodie: which vertue, and power, quickneth my dead Å¿oule, maketh me to liue the life of ChriÅ¿t, to beginne to die to my Å¿elfe: and euer the more I die to my Å¿elfe, the more I liue to ChriÅ¿t: This coniunction nowe is the ground as I told you, of all our felicitie, and happineÅ¿Å¿e, and I haue made it cleere
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20181:54"/>to you at this time, Å¿o farre as God hath giuen me inÅ¿ight: Alwaies yee Å¿ee, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction is brought to paÅ¿Å¿e, by two Å¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes; by the holy Å¿pirit, and by faith, If there bee no other meanes, but theÅ¿e two, what needeÅ¿t thou a carnall, or a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible coniunction? Faith is inviÅ¿ible, and the Å¿pirit is inuiÅ¿ible, therefore thou canÅ¿t not Å¿ee it, nor take it vp with the eye of thy bodie: The power of the holy Å¿pirit is Å¿o Å¿ubtile, Å¿ecret, and inuiÅ¿ible, that thou canÅ¿t not perceiue it, nor take it vppe, with the eye of thy bodie, and it will worke great effects in thy Å¿oule, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou perceiueÅ¿t his working: In reÅ¿pect therefore, that the meanes of this coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are Å¿o Å¿ubtill, Å¿ecret, and Å¿pirituall, why thinkeÅ¿t thou to get a Å¿ight of this coniunction, with the eye of thy bodie? why imagineÅ¿t thou, Å¿uch a carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, as this, which would doe thee no good, if thou hadÅ¿t it? knowÅ¿t thou not, that the Å¿pirit, that coupleth vs, and ChriÅ¿t, is infinite? Å¿o that it is as eaÅ¿ie for the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to couplevs and ChriÅ¿t, how farre diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Å¿oeuer wee bee, as it is eaÅ¿ie for our Å¿oules, to couple our head and the feete of our bodies, though they be diÅ¿tant. Then
<pb facs="tcp:20181:55"/>Å¿eeing this coniunction is the ground &amp; fountaine of all our happineÅ¿Å¿e: And Å¿eeing this ground of happineÅ¿Å¿e is Å¿o Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, and Å¿o Å¿pirituall, What is your part?

It is not posÅ¿ible, that yee can get any inÅ¿ight in it. But if the Lord of his mercy, will beÅ¿towe Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure of his holy Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vpon you; out of queÅ¿tion, yee Å¿hall Å¿oone come to the vnderÅ¿tanding of it, and yee Å¿hall thinke the time happie, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yee heard this word. Except yee haue Å¿ome part of this Å¿pirit, it is not posÅ¿ible that yee canne bee Å¿pirituall.</p>
            <p>That which is borne of fleÅ¿h and bloode, will remaine fleÅ¿h and bloud, except the Å¿pirit come in and make it Å¿pirituall.</p>
            <p>Therefore yee muÅ¿t bee borne againe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20181:55"/>of the Å¿pirit, yee muÅ¿t bee borne in the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, his Å¿pirit muÅ¿t quicken you.</p>
            <p>This is called the quickning, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Å¿pirit of ChriÅ¿t, by <hi>Iohn.</hi> And Å¿o Å¿oone as this Å¿pirit cometh, what doth it? It chaÅ¿eth away darkneÅ¿Å¿e out of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding: whereas before, I knewe not God, now I Å¿ee him, not onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that he is a God, but that he is my God in ChriÅ¿t: what more doth the holy Å¿pirit? It opneth the heart, as well as the minde: and what doth it there? ThoÅ¿e things, whereon I beÅ¿towed the affection of my heart, and imployed the loue of my Å¿oule, are by the working of the holy Å¿pirit, made gall to mee, he makes then venome to mee, and to bee as deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of mee, as poyÅ¿on: Hee worketh Å¿uch an inward diÅ¿poÅ¿ition in my Å¿oule, that hee makes mee to turne, and flie from thoÅ¿e things whereon I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed my loue before, and to imploy it vpon God: This is a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Alwayes in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, he makes mee to loue God better then anie other thing: Hee changeth the affections and inclinations of my Å¿oule,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:56"/>he changeth the faculties, and qualities of my Å¿oule: And though our hearts &amp; minde be made new, yet the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of them is not changed, but onely the faculties, and qualities are changed, in reÅ¿pect of the which change, wee are called new creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, &amp; except you be found newe creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
<note place="margin">ConcluÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> yee are not in ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the poynt. This Å¿ecret Coniunction is brought to paÅ¿Å¿e, by faith, and by the holy Å¿pirit: by faith wee lay hold on the bodie, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t: And though wee bee as farre diÅ¿tant, as heauen and earth are; the Å¿pirit Å¿erues vs, as a ladder to conioyne vs with ChriÅ¿t: As the ladder of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which reached from the ground to the heauen, to the Å¿elfe Å¿ame vÅ¿e, Å¿erueth the Å¿pirit of God, to conioyne the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, with my Å¿oule. Then obÅ¿erue the whole in a word: what makes you to haue anie right, or title to ChriÅ¿t? Nothing, but the Å¿pirit: Nothing, but faith. What Å¿hould bee your Å¿tudie then? Seeke by all meanes posÅ¿ible, to gett faith: That as Peter, Acts the 15.9. Å¿ayeth, your hearts and conÅ¿ciences, may be Å¿anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith: And if you endeuour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20181:56"/>not, as well to get faith in your hearts, as in your mindes, your faith auaileth not. What auaileth the faith, that fleeteth in the fantaÅ¿ie, and brings a naked knowledge, without the opening of the heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent of the will? So, there muÅ¿t be an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy hart, and conÅ¿ent of thy will, to doe that thing, that God commandeth, or elÅ¿e, thy faith availeth not: Then Å¿triue to get faith in your hearts, and mindes; and doing Å¿o, yee doe the duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians: This is not done, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hearing of the word, and diligent receiuing of the Sacrament. Then be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in theÅ¿e exerciÅ¿es, and be diligent in prayer: Praying in the holy GhoÅ¿t, that hee would nouriÅ¿h your Å¿oules inwardlie, with the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t: That hee would increaÅ¿e faith in your hearts, and mindes, and make it to grow vp more and more daily, vntill you come to the full fruition of that bleÅ¿Å¿ed immortality: Vnto the which, the Lord of his mercie bring vs; and that for the righteous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us: To whome with the Father, and the holy GhoÅ¿t, bee all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praiÅ¿e, and glorie, both now and euer: Amen.</p>

               <q>For I haue receiued of the Lord, that which I alÅ¿o haue deliuered vnto you: to wit, that the Lord IeÅ¿us, in the night that hee was betraied, tooke bread, &amp;c.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE haue heard (wel-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us) in our laÅ¿t exerciÅ¿e, what names were giuen to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, as well in the Scriptures, as by the Auncientes, of the Latine, and EaÅ¿t Churches: wee hearde the chiefe ends wherefore, and wherevnto, this holy Sacrament was at firÅ¿t inÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: wee heard the things, that were contained in this Sacrament, what they were, how they are coupled, how they are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20181:57"/>deliuered, and how they are receiued: wee heard alÅ¿o, Å¿ome obiections, that might bee obiected, to the contrarie of this doctrine: wee heard them propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and as God gaue the grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: wee heard how the faythfull Å¿oule, is Å¿aid to eate ChriÅ¿ts bodie, and drinke ChriÅ¿ts blood: Wee heard the manner, how ChriÅ¿t is, or canne bee, receiued of vs: And we concluded in this poynt, That ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, the Sauiour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, our Sauiour, cannot bee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, nor yet receiued, but by a Å¿pirituall way, &amp; apprehenÅ¿ion. Neyther the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, nor the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, nor ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, can bee perceiued, but by the eye of fayth; can bee receiued, but by the mouth of faith; nor can be layd hold on, but by the hand of fayth.</p>
            <p>Now faith is a Å¿piritual thing: for fayth is the gift of God, poured downe into the heartes and mindes of men, and women, wrought in the Å¿oule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, and that by the mightie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and operation of the holy Å¿pirit. So, the onely waie to laie holde on ChriÅ¿t, being by faith, and faith of it owne nature, beeing Å¿piritual, it followeth
<pb facs="tcp:20181:58"/>therefore that there is no waie to lay hold on ChriÅ¿t, but a Å¿pirituall way: there is not a hand: to faÅ¿ten on ChriÅ¿t, but aÅ¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hand, there is not a mouth, to digeÅ¿t ChriÅ¿t, but a Å¿pirituall mouth: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Å¿amiliarly by all theÅ¿e tearmes, deÅ¿cribe the nature, and efficacie of faith.
<note place="margin">How we are Å¿aid to eate the fleÅ¿h, and drinke the blood of ChriÅ¿t.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Wee are Å¿aid to eate the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t by faith, and to drink his bloud by faith, in this Sacrament: chiefely in doing of two things: FirÅ¿t, in calling to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the bitter death, and pasÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ChriÅ¿t, the blood that hee Å¿hedde vpon the croÅ¿Å¿e, the Supper which he inÅ¿tituted, in remembrance of him, before he went to the CroÅ¿Å¿e: The commandement which hee gaue: <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> I Å¿ay, wee eate his fleÅ¿h, and drinke his bloode Å¿piritually. FirÅ¿t in this poynt, in recording, and remembring faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, how hee died for vs, how his blood was Å¿hedde vpon the croÅ¿Å¿e. This is the firÅ¿t poynt, a point that cannot be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred truly, except it be wrought, by the mightie power of the holy Å¿pirit. The Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poynt of the Å¿pirituall eating, Å¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this, That I, and euerie one of you,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20181:58"/>beleeue firmly, that he died for mee, in particular: That his bloud, was Å¿hedde on the croÅ¿Å¿e, for a full remisÅ¿ion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of me, and my Å¿innes. The cheefe, and principall poynt, of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ChriÅ¿t his fleÅ¿h, and drinking of his blood, Å¿tandeth in beleeuing firmely, that that fleÅ¿h, was deliuered to death for my Å¿innes; that that blood, of his, was Å¿hedde, for the remisÅ¿ion of my Å¿innes: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, euerie Å¿oule come neere to himÅ¿elfe, and firmely conÅ¿ent, and agree, and bee perÅ¿waded, that ChriÅ¿t died for him: that Å¿oule can not be Å¿aued, that Å¿oule cannot eate the fleÅ¿h, nor drinke the blood of ChriÅ¿t. Then the eating of the fleÅ¿h, and drinking of the blood of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿tandeth in a faithfull memorie, in a firme beleefe, and in a true applying, of the merits of the death, and pasÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t, to my owne conÅ¿cience in particular.</p>
            <p>Ther were Å¿undry things obiected, againÅ¿t this kind of receiuing: I wil not inÅ¿iÅ¿t to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them: But beÅ¿ide all the obiections, which ye heard obiected, againÅ¿t this kind of Å¿piritual receiuing by faith; They Å¿ay, If ChriÅ¿t his fleÅ¿h, nor his blood, be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, nor receiued, but by the Å¿pirit, by
<pb facs="tcp:20181:59"/>fayth in the Å¿pirit: Then Å¿ay they, yee receiue him, but by an imagination: If hee bee not receiued carnally, nor corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but onely by the Å¿pirit, and by faith; Then is hee not receiued, but by way of imagination, conceite, and fantaÅ¿ie. So they account faith, an imagination of the minde, a fantaÅ¿ie, and opinion, fleeting in the hearts of men: I cannot blame them, to think Å¿o of faith: For, as none can iudge of the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e of honnie, but they, that haue taÅ¿ted of it: So, there is none, can diÅ¿cerne, nor iudge of the nature of faith, but they that haue felt it, and raÅ¿ted in their hearts, what it is: And if they had taÅ¿ted, and felt in their Å¿oules, what faith brings with it; alas, they would not call that Å¿pirituall Iewell, and onely iewell of the Å¿oule, an imagination. They call it an imagination: and the ApoÅ¿tle deÅ¿cribing it, Heb. 11.1. calleth it a Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, and a Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall ground: Marke how well theÅ¿e two agree, <hi>An Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall ground.</hi> They call it an vncertaine opinion, fleeting in the braine, and fantaÅ¿ie of man: Hee call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th it an euidence, and demonÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Å¿ame definition; See how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20181:59"/>contrarie, the ApoÅ¿tle and they are, in the nature of faith. Vpon this they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that as it is true in generall, hee can not be deliuered, nor giuen, but that Å¿ame way, that hee is receiued; and looke what way any thing is receiued, the Å¿ame way it is giuen, and deliuered: So (as they Å¿ay) hee being receiued by way of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee is alÅ¿o in their fantaÅ¿ie, giuen and deliuered by way of Imagination. For if hee bee not giuen Å¿ay they, to thy hand, to thy mouth, nor to thy Å¿tomach cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally: hee cannot be giuen, but by an imagination, and fantaÅ¿ticall opinion. The reaÅ¿on that moueth them to thinke, that ChriÅ¿t cannot bee theirs, nor giuen to them truly in effect, and really, except he be giuen carnally, is this: That thing which is Å¿o far abÅ¿ent, and diÅ¿tant from vs, as the heauen is from the earth, cannot be Å¿aid to bee giuen to vs, nor to bee ours: But by your owne confesÅ¿ion, Å¿ay they to vs, ChriÅ¿t his bodie, is as farre abÅ¿ent from vs, as the heauen is, from the earth: Therefore ChriÅ¿t his bodie, nor his fleÅ¿h, cannot be giuen vnto vs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by way of imagination, and Å¿o not truely, nor in effect: This argument,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:60"/>framed in this Å¿orte, would at the firÅ¿t Å¿ight, Å¿eeme to be of Å¿ome force. But let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the propoÅ¿ition of it: The propoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this. <hi>That thing which is Å¿o farre abÅ¿ent from vs, as the beauen is from the earth, cannot be Å¿aid to be deliuered to vs, to be giuen to vs, or any waies to be ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether is this propoÅ¿ition true or falÅ¿e? I Å¿ay this propoÅ¿ition is vntrue, and the contrarie moÅ¿t true. A thing may be giuen to vs, &amp; may become ours, though the thing in perÅ¿on it Å¿elfe, be as far diÅ¿tant from vs, as the heauen is, from the earth. And how proue I this? What maketh any thing to be ours? What maketh any of you, eÅ¿teeme a thing to be giuen vnto you? Is it not a Title? Is it not a iuÅ¿t right to that thing? If yee haue iuÅ¿t right giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, by him, who hath power to giue it; and a Å¿ure title, confirmed to you, by him, who hath the power; though the thing, that he giueth vnto you, be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered into your handes, yet by the right and title, which hee granteth to you, is not the thing yours? There is no doubt of it, for it is not the neereneÅ¿Å¿e of the thing, to my bodie, and to my hand, that maketh the thing mine; for it may bee in my hand,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20181:60"/>and yet not belong to mee. Neyther is it the diÅ¿tance nor abÅ¿ence: of the thing, that makes it, not to be mine, but it may be farre abÅ¿ent from mee, and yet be mine, becauÅ¿e the title is mine, &amp; becauÅ¿e, I haue gotten a right to it, from him, who hath the power to giue it. So then, this ground is true, It is a Å¿ure title, and a iuÅ¿t right, that maketh a thing, though it be farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant from vs, to bee ours. But Å¿o it is, that a liuely, and trew faith, in the blood, and death of ChriÅ¿t, maketh vs to haue a Å¿ure title, and a good right to the fleÅ¿h, and blood of ChriÅ¿t, and to his merits: look what he merited by his death, and Å¿hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his bloud vpon the croÅ¿Å¿e; all that, together with himÅ¿elfe alÅ¿o, appertaineth to mee, and that by a title and a right, which I haue gotten to him, of God; which is faith: And the Å¿urer that my title is, the more Å¿ure am I, of the thing that is giuen mee by the Title. Now this Sacrament, of the Lords Supper, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tituted, to confirme our title, to Å¿eal vp our right, which wee haue to the bodie, and blood, to the death, and pasÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t: and Å¿o, the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, is Å¿aid to be giuen to vs, The blood of ChriÅ¿t, is Å¿aid
<pb facs="tcp:20181:61"/>to be deliuered to vs, when our title, which we haue of him, of his death, of his bodie, &amp; blood, is confirmed in our hearts. For this Sacrament was inÅ¿tituted, for the grouth and encreaÅ¿e of our faith, for the increaÅ¿e of our holineÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿anctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which fayth, the greater that it is in our hearts, the more Å¿ure are wee, that ChriÅ¿t his death appertaineth to vs. I grant as I haue Å¿aid, that the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, is not deliuered into my hands, his fleÅ¿h is not put into my mouth, nor entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Å¿tomacke: Yet God forbidde, that thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t Å¿ay, Hee is not truly giuen, although ChriÅ¿ts fleÅ¿h, bee not put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy hand, nor mouth of thy bodie: and wherefore Å¿hould it? Hath hee not appointed breade, and wine, for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hment of the bodie, and may not that content you? Are they not Å¿ufficient to nouriÅ¿h you, to this earthly and temporall life? Hath he not appointed ChriÅ¿t to bee deliuered, to the inward mouth of thy Å¿oule, to be giuen into the hand of thy Å¿oule, that thy Å¿oule may feede on him, and be quickned with that life, wherewith the Angels liue, wherewith the Å¿onne of God, and God himÅ¿elfe liue?</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:20181:61"/>
            <p>So the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, is not appointed to nouriÅ¿h thy body, but to nouriÅ¿h thy Å¿oule, in the hope, yea, in the growth of that immortall life: and therfore, I Å¿ay, though the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t bee not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the hand of thy body, yet it is deliuered to that part that it Å¿hould nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h: the Å¿oule is that part that it Å¿hould nouriÅ¿h, therefore to the Å¿oule it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
            <p>Yea, that bread, &amp; that wine, are no more really deliuered to the body &amp; to the hand of the body, then the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the Å¿oule, and to the hand and mouth of the Å¿oule, vvhich is faith: therefore craue no more a carnall deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor thinke not vpon a carnall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
            <p>Thou muÅ¿t not thinke, that eyther GOD giueth the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t to the mouth of the bodie; or that thou, by the mouth of thy bodie, receiueÅ¿t the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t: For yee muÅ¿t vnderÅ¿tand this principle in the Scriptures of GOD; our Å¿oules cannot be ioyned with the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t; nor the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, cannot be ioyned vvith our Å¿oules, but by a Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all band. Not by a carnall band, of bloud
<pb facs="tcp:20181:62"/>and alliance; not by the touching of his fleÅ¿h, with our fleÅ¿h: but hee is conioyned with vs by a Å¿pirituall band; that is, by the power, and vertue of his holy Spirit. And therefore the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. That by the meanes of his holy Å¿pirit, all wee, who are faithfull men and vvomen, are baptized into one body of ChriÅ¿t. That is, wee are conioyned, and faÅ¿tened with one ChriÅ¿t; by the meanes, Å¿aith he, of one Å¿pirit: not by a carnall band, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groÅ¿Å¿e coniunction; but onely by the band of the holy Å¿pirit.</p>
            <p>That Å¿ame holy Å¿pirit that is in him, is in euery one of vs, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure: and in reÅ¿pect one Å¿pirit is in him, and in vs, therefore, wee are accounted all to be one body, and to bee members of one Å¿pirituall, and myÅ¿ticall body. And in the Å¿ame verÅ¿e, the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, Wee are all made to drink into one and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame Å¿pirit: that is, we are made to drink of the bloud of ChriÅ¿t. And this bloud is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but the quickning vertue, and power that floweth from ChriÅ¿t, and from the merits of his death: we are made all to drinke of that bloud, when wee drinke of the liuely power and vertue, that floweth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20181:62"/>out of that bloud.</p>
            <p>So, there is not a band that can couple my Å¿oule with the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a Å¿pirituall band, and a Å¿pirituall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore it is that the ApoÅ¿tle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. Å¿aith, <hi>Hee that is ioyned vnto the Lord, is one Å¿pirit.</hi> And, <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>That vvhich is borne of the Å¿pirit, is Å¿pirit.</hi> So, it is onely by the participation of the holy Å¿pirit, that we are conioyned with the fleÅ¿h and bloud of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us.</p>
            <p>That carnall band, vvhether it bee the band of bloud, vvhich runnes thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough one race, or the carnall touching of fleÅ¿h, vvith fleÅ¿h, that carnall band (I Å¿ay) vvas neuer eÅ¿teemed of by ChriÅ¿t. In the time that hee was conuerÅ¿ant heere vpon earth, hee reÅ¿pected nothing that band: for, as hee vvitneÅ¿Å¿ed himÅ¿elfe, by his owne vvords, hee neuer had that carnall band in any kinde of reuerence, or eÅ¿timation, in reÅ¿pect of the Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all band.</p>
            <p>But, as for the Å¿pirituall band, whereby we are coupled with him by one Å¿pirit; hee euer eÅ¿teemed of this band, in the time that he was conuerÅ¿ant on earth, &amp; in his word, he hath left the praiÅ¿e and commendations
<pb facs="tcp:20181:63"/>of the Å¿ame.</p>
            <p>To let you Å¿ee how lightly he eÅ¿teemed of the carnall band of bloud and alliance, which wee eÅ¿teeme Å¿o much; yee may Å¿ee in the eight of <hi>Luke,</hi> 20.21. for there they comming to him, Å¿ay, <hi>MaÅ¿ter, thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thy Brethren Å¿tand vvithout, and vvould Å¿ee thee:</hi> ye Å¿hall heare his anÅ¿were vnto them, how little he eÅ¿teemed of that carnall band; in the 21. <hi>verÅ¿e,</hi> in a manner denying that band, hee Å¿aith; <hi>My Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my Brethren, are thoÅ¿e which heare the vvord of God, and doe it.</hi> As if he would haue Å¿aid, It is not that carnall band that I eÅ¿teeme: it is not that carnall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I reuerence: it is the Å¿pirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, by the participation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Spirit; vvhereby wee are mooued to heare the word of God, to giue reuerence to it, and to obey it.</p>
            <p>This carnall band, was neuer profitable, as that in the 8. of <hi>Luke</hi> doth plainly teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: for, if the touching of ChriÅ¿tes fleÅ¿h had been profitable, the multitude, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made in that chapter, that thruÅ¿ted, and preaÅ¿ed him, had beene the better by their carnall touching. But Å¿o it is, that there was neuer any of them the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20181:63"/>better by their carnall touching; therfore the carnall touching profiteth nothing. Saith not ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.63. (to drawe them from that Å¿iniÅ¿ter confidence they had in his fleÅ¿h onely) <hi>My fleÅ¿h profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing; It is the Å¿pirit that quickneth?</hi> To touch him by the holie Spirit, and by faith in thy Å¿oule; this touching by faith, hath euer been profitable, and wee haue a plaine example of it in the Å¿ame chapter.</p>
            <p>Euen Å¿o, the poore vvoman, that had long been diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed vvith a bloudie iÅ¿Å¿ue, the Å¿pace of twelue yeeres, and had vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted, and conÅ¿umed the greateÅ¿t part of her Å¿ubÅ¿tance, in Å¿eeking remedie; Å¿hee found no helpe by the naturall and bodily PhyÅ¿ition: at the laÅ¿t, by vertue of the holie Spirit, working faith in her heart, Å¿hee vnderÅ¿tands and conceiues, that Å¿hee is able to recouer the health of her bodie, and the health of her Å¿oule from ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, vvho came to Å¿aue both body and Å¿oule. And vpon this perÅ¿waÅ¿ion which Å¿hee had in her hart, that ChriÅ¿t could cure both body and Å¿oule, Å¿hee came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and as the Text Å¿aith, Å¿hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed thorough the multitude, to come to
<pb facs="tcp:20181:64"/>him: and when Å¿he was come, it is not Å¿aid that Å¿he touched his fleÅ¿h with her hand (in caÅ¿e the PapiÅ¿ts would aÅ¿cribe the vertue which came out of him, to her carnall touching): but it is Å¿aid, that Å¿he touched onely the hemme of his garment with her hand; and with faith, vvhich is the hand of the Å¿oule, Å¿hee touched her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, God, and man. And, to let you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand that Å¿hee touched him by Å¿aith, hee Å¿aith to her at the laÅ¿t, <hi>Goe thy way, thy faith hath Å¿aued thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shee touched him not Å¿o Å¿oon by faith, but incontment, there came a power out of him: which power and vertue, Å¿hee felt, by the effect of it in her Å¿oule; and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour felt it, vvhen it went from him. The effect vvhereby Å¿hee felt it, was, the health of her Å¿oule: and the effect wherby he felt it, was, the going from him. And Å¿o Å¿oone as hee felt it goe from him, he Å¿aith, Who is it that hath touched mee? <hi>Peter</hi> (who was euer moÅ¿t Å¿uddaine) anÅ¿wereth, and Å¿aith, Thou art thronged, and thruÅ¿ted by the multitude, and yet thou askeÅ¿t, Who hath touched thee.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour anÅ¿wers againe, It is not that touching, that I Å¿peake of; it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20181:64"/>kinde of touching. There is one hath touched me, who hath drawn a vertue and power out of mee: the multitude takes no vertue from me. The poore woman, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Å¿he had done amiÅ¿Å¿e, and perceiuing that Å¿he could not be hid, came trembling, and Å¿aid; I haue done it. Hee anÅ¿wered her at the laÅ¿t, and Å¿aid, <hi>Depart in peace; thy faith hath Å¿aued thee.</hi> Thy faith hath drawn out a vertue, &amp; power from me, that hath made both thy Å¿oule &amp; body whole.</p>
            <p>So that this touching of ChriÅ¿t, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer been profitable; is, and Å¿hall be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: like as the touching of ChriÅ¿t, with the corporall hand, hath neuer beene, is not, nor euer Å¿hall be profitable. And why? ChriÅ¿t is not appointed to be a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall head; to be Å¿et vpon the necks of our bodies, that he may doe the office of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall head therunto, to furniÅ¿h naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; Å¿enÅ¿es to our bodies. No, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call not ChriÅ¿t a natural head, but the Scriptures call him a Å¿pirituall head, to be Å¿et on the neck of our Å¿oules: that is, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ioyned with our Å¿oules; that out of him, into our Å¿oules may diÅ¿till holy motions, heauenly Å¿enÅ¿es; and that there may flowe out of him to vs, a Å¿piritual &amp; heauenly life.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:65"/>
            <p>Then the Scriptures call him a Å¿piritu-head, as they call vs a Å¿pirituall body: and, as the life which wee get from him, is Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; Å¿o all our coniunction with him, is Å¿pirituall. And in reÅ¿pect he worketh that Å¿ame operation in my Å¿oule, vvhich the carnall head doth in my body, therefore hee is called a Å¿pirituall head: therefore hee is called the head of his Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e hee furniÅ¿heth her vvith Å¿pirituall motion, and Å¿enÅ¿es, vvhich is the life of the Church.</p>
            <p>So, to be Å¿hort, there is nothing in this coniunction, carnall; there is nothing groÅ¿Å¿e in it; there is nothing that may be compaÅ¿Å¿ed, by our naturall iudgement &amp; vnderÅ¿tanding. And therefore, whoÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would attaine to any Å¿mall in-Å¿ight of this Å¿piritual coniunction, between ChriÅ¿t, and vs; of neceÅ¿sity, hee muÅ¿t humble himÅ¿elfe, and earneÅ¿tly pray for the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; otherwiÅ¿e, it is not poÅ¿sible to get any vnderÅ¿tanding, no, not the leaÅ¿t perÅ¿eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, how the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t, and vve are conioyned, except we haue Å¿ome light gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs by the Å¿pirit; that is, except our harts be wakened, by the mighty working of the Å¿pirit of ChriÅ¿t, this Å¿hall remaine as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20181:65"/>a dead, and cloÅ¿ed letter vnto vs. So,
<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> yee are to craue, that the Lord in his mercie would waken you; illuminate your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tandings; and make you to haue a Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall light, to diÅ¿cerne of theÅ¿e Å¿pirituall things. Next, ye muÅ¿t Å¿tudy, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to remoue all vaine cogitations, and earthly fantaÅ¿ies: when yee come to heare Å¿o high a matter, yee muÅ¿t caÅ¿t off all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thoughts, ill motions, and cares of the world; and yee muÅ¿t Å¿hake off all things that clogge your harts. Thirdly, yee muÅ¿t come with a purpoÅ¿e to heare the vvord, to giue diligent care to the word, and with a Å¿anctified hart to receiue it; vvith a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e to growe, and increaÅ¿e in holineÅ¿s, as well in body, as in Å¿oule, all the dayes of your life.</p>
            <p>And, comming with this purpoÅ¿e, no queÅ¿tion, the holy Spirit Å¿hall reueale thoÅ¿e things to you, which yee want. And though this word paÅ¿Å¿e, and bring no great commodity for the preÅ¿ent, yet the holy Spirit heereafter, Å¿hall reueale to thee, the truth of that which thou haÅ¿t now heard. Then this is the end of all; Bee preÅ¿ent in your harts, and mindes, and let your Å¿oules be emptied of all the cares of the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:66"/>vvorld, that they may receiue that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is offered in the hearing of the word.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the defining of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper.
<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</note> I call this Sacrament, <hi>A holy Seale,</hi> annexed to the couenant of grace, and mercy in ChriÅ¿t. A Å¿eale to be miniÅ¿tred publiquely, alwaies according to the holy inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us: that by the lawful miniÅ¿tery therof, the Sacramentall vnion, betweene the Å¿ignes, and the thing Å¿ignified, may Å¿tand: and this vnion Å¿tanding, ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, who is the thing Å¿ignified, is as truely deliuered to the increaÅ¿e of our Å¿pirituall nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Å¿ignes are giuen, &amp; deliuered to the body, for our temporall nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now let vs examine the words &amp; parts of this definition.
<note place="margin">Why this Sacrament is called a Seale.</note> FirÅ¿t of all, I call this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, a Seale; becauÅ¿e this Sacrament Å¿erueth to the Å¿ame vÅ¿e to our Å¿oules, that a common Å¿eale doth to a common Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. As the Å¿eale, which is annexed to the Euidence, confirmes, and Å¿eales vp the truth, contained in the Euidence: Å¿o this Sacrament, of the body and bloud of ChriÅ¿t, confirmeth, and Å¿ealeth vp, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20181:66"/>truth of mercy and grace, contayned in the couenant of mercy and grace: for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect it is called a Å¿eale.</p>
            <p>It is called, <hi>A holy Seale.</hi> Why?
<note place="margin">Why it is called a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seale.</note> BecauÅ¿e it is taken from the profane vÅ¿e, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that bread Å¿erued before; and that bread is applyed to a holy vÅ¿e. There is a power giuen to that bread, to Å¿ignifie the precious body of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, to repreÅ¿ent the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hing, and feeding of our Å¿oules. And in reÅ¿pect it Å¿erueth now in the Sacrament to Å¿o holy an vÅ¿e, therefore I call it an holie Å¿eale. This is not my word; it is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. where hee giueth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the Å¿ame name, and calleth it a Å¿eale. And further, if the wiÅ¿dom of ChriÅ¿t in his ApoÅ¿tle, had been followed, and if men had not inuented new names of their own, for this Sacrament, but contented, &amp; Å¿atisfied themÅ¿elues, with the names which God hath giuen by his ApoÅ¿tle, &amp; that Chr. himÅ¿elf hath giuen to this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t; I am aÅ¿Å¿ured, none of theÅ¿e controuerÅ¿ies &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bares (which neuer will ceaÅ¿e) had fallen out: but where men wil go about to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿er the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> God, &amp; go beyond God, in deuiÅ¿ing names which he neuer gaue, vpon mens own inuentions, Å¿uch debates haue faln out.
<pb facs="tcp:20181:67"/>A leÅ¿Å¿on by the vvay; that no fleÅ¿h pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume to be wiÅ¿er then GOD: but let them Å¿toupe, and keepe the names which God hath giuen to this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Why the Å¿eale is Å¿aid to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> I Å¿ay, annexed to the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; annexed, and hung to the Charter: becauÅ¿e it cannot be called a Å¿eale proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except it be hung to an Euidence. What it is by nature, the Å¿ame it remaineth, and no more, if it be not annexed to Å¿ome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence: it is onely the hanging of it to the Euidence, that maketh men account it a Å¿eale; not beeing eÅ¿teemed, except it be hanged to the Euidence. Euen Å¿o it is heere; if this Sacrament be not miniÅ¿tred, and ioyned to the preached vvord, to the preaching of the couenant of mercie, and grace, it cannot be a Å¿eale; but what it is by nature, it is no more. As by nature, it is but a common peece of bread; Å¿o it is no more if it be not annexed to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, and miniÅ¿tred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as ChriÅ¿t hath commaunded. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I Å¿ay, the Å¿eale muÅ¿t be annexed, and hanged to the Euidence, to the preaching of the word, for the confirming of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence; otherwiÅ¿e, it is not a Å¿eale. But, it is not Å¿o with the Euidence vvhich is the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20181:67"/>word of GOD: for yee knowe, any Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will make faith, though it vvant a Å¿eale; and it will Å¿erue to make a right, if it be Å¿ubÅ¿cribed, without a Å¿eale: but the Å¿eale without the Euidence, auaileth nothing. Euen Å¿o it is with the word of God: though the Sacraments bee not annexed to the word, yet the word will Å¿erue the turne: it Å¿erueth vs to get ChriÅ¿t, it Å¿erueth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender, and beget faith in vs, and maketh vs to growe vp in faith. But the Å¿eale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word, can Å¿erue vs to no holievÅ¿e: therefore, I Å¿ay, the Å¿eale muÅ¿t be annexed to the word preached, to the couenant of mercy, and grace.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth in the definition,
<note place="margin">Why the Sacrament Å¿hould be miniÅ¿tred publiquely.</note> that this Å¿eale muÅ¿t bee miniÅ¿tred publiquely. Wherefore Å¿ay I publiquely? To exclude all priuat adminiÅ¿tration of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t. For, if this Sacrament be adminiÅ¿tred to any priuately, it is not a Sacrament. Why?
<note place="margin">FirÅ¿t reaÅ¿on.</note> BecauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tle calleth this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Communion. If ye adminiÅ¿ter it to one, yee loÅ¿e the Communion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if yee adminiÅ¿ter it priuatly, yee loÅ¿e the Sacrament. For this Sacrament, is a Communion of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t: therefore, of neceÅ¿sity, it muÅ¿t be
<pb facs="tcp:20181:68"/>by way of communication; and Å¿o the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muÅ¿t be publiquely miniÅ¿tred.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Sacrament muÅ¿t be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely miniÅ¿tred,
<note place="margin">Second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on.</note> becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, vvho is the thing Å¿ignified in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is no Å¿uch thing as pertaineth but to one man only: if this were Å¿o, he might be priuatly giuen and miniÅ¿tred. But, Å¿eeing ChriÅ¿t, which is the thing Å¿ignified in the Sacrament, is a common thing, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to euery faithfull man and vvoman, therefore hee ought to be commonly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all, in a common action, in a Å¿oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, and congregation of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this Sacrament, is a ThankÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God the Father, for his benefits. Now, it appertaineth not to one, or tvvo, to thanke God onely; but as we are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his temporall, and Å¿pirituall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: Å¿o we ought all of vs, publiquely to giue him thanks for the Å¿ame. Therefore I Å¿ay, in the definition, this Å¿eale ought to be publiquely, and not priuatly miniÅ¿tred; as the PapiÅ¿ts doe in their priuat MaÅ¿Å¿es.</p>
            <p>This Seale muÅ¿t bee publiquely mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tred, according to ChriÅ¿t his inÅ¿titution. Wherfore Å¿ay I ChriÅ¿t his inÅ¿titution, more then mans inÅ¿titution, or Angels inÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20181:68"/>Why keepe I to ChriÅ¿t his inÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<note place="margin">Why this Seale muÅ¿t be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chr. his inÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> BecauÅ¿e man hath not power to inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, or make a Sacrament: becauÅ¿e an Angel hath not power to make, or inÅ¿titute a Sacrament. For, none hath power to make, or inÅ¿titute a Sacrament, but he that hath power to giue ChriÅ¿t, vvho is the thing Å¿ignified in the Sacrament.
<note place="margin">None hath power to inÅ¿titute a Sacrament, but God onely.</note> But Å¿o it is, that none hath power to giue ChriÅ¿t, but either the Father, or himÅ¿elfe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, none hath power to make, or inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Sacrament, but either the Father, or the Sonne: onely God muÅ¿t make a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, this Sacrament is a part of Gods Å¿eruice, and worÅ¿hip: but Å¿o it is that none hath power to appoint any part of his Å¿eruice, or preÅ¿cribe any part of his worÅ¿hip, but onely God himÅ¿elfe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none can make a Sacrament, but God himÅ¿elfe. There is no Prince will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be Å¿erued after another mans fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taÅ¿ie: but he will preÅ¿cribe his Å¿eruice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto his own pleaÅ¿ure: how much more is it meet, that God Å¿hould appoint his owne Å¿eruice, and worÅ¿hip? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is neither man, nor Angel, hath power to inÅ¿titute any part of the Å¿eruice of GOD.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:69"/>
            <p>The Sacraments are a part of his Å¿eruice: therefore there is no Angel, nor man, hath power to inÅ¿titute a Sacrament. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t Å¿tile that any man can haue in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿tery of the word and Sacraments, is that Å¿tile, which the ApoÅ¿tle giues them, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. There we are called Stewards, and DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ers of the graces of God; MiniÅ¿ters of thoÅ¿e myÅ¿teries, and holy things. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth then, that we are not Authors, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, and makers of them; but onely Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters, and diÅ¿penÅ¿ers of the Sacraments. So, it is euident, that no man, nor creature, hath power to make a Sacrament. Then it muÅ¿t bee according to the inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, his inÅ¿titution muÅ¿t be kept: looke what he Å¿aid, what he did, what hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee to doe; all that muÅ¿t be Å¿aid, done, and obeyed. If thou leaueÅ¿t one iote of that vndone, which he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee to doe, thou peruerteÅ¿t the inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: for, there is nothing left in regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter of that inÅ¿titution, but it is eÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.</p>
            <p>So, in the celebration of ChriÅ¿ts inÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee muÅ¿t take heede, to whatÅ¿oeuer he Å¿aid, did, or commaunded to bee done: Thou muÅ¿t firÅ¿t Å¿ay, whatÅ¿oeuer hee Å¿aid,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20181:69"/>&amp; then do whatÅ¿oeuer he did. For the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿terie of the Sacrament muÅ¿t follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the word. FirÅ¿t thou muÅ¿t Å¿ay, that which ChriÅ¿t commanded thee to Å¿ay, and thou muÅ¿t teach, that which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee to teach: and then miniÅ¿ter the Sacrament: Then to keepe this inÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee muÅ¿t beginne at the Å¿aying,
<note place="margin">We call the word in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the whole InÅ¿titution</note> and Å¿ay whatÅ¿oeuer ChriÅ¿t commanded vs, then after, faythfully to doe all that, which he commanded to be done. Then I call the word, the whole inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us, preached, and proclaimed, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced diÅ¿tinctly, cleerely, and Å¿enÅ¿iblie to the people, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that if wee leaue anie kinde of circumÅ¿tance, or ceremonie of this inÅ¿titution vndone, wee peruert the whole action.</p>
            <p>It is agreed vpon,
<note place="margin">Word and element muÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the conÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> and condeÅ¿cended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, betweene vs, who celebrate this inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and all the Å¿ectes in the world, who haue Å¿eparated themÅ¿elues from this inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, That two things are neceÅ¿Å¿arie, and muÅ¿t concurre in the nature, and conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sacrament. To wit, there muÅ¿t be a word, and there muÅ¿t bee an element concurring: There is not a Å¿ect, that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not this, That the word muÅ¿t concur,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:70"/>with the element, before there can be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Though they eaÅ¿ily admit this generall, wherein wee agree well with them, yet when it comes to the Å¿peciall, &amp; that wee enter into particular, in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and treating of the word; how well Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee agree in the generall, yet in the particular, wee are as farre aÅ¿under. For, when wee come to diÅ¿pute, and reaÅ¿on on theÅ¿e particulars; FirÅ¿t, what wee meane by the word: Secondly, how this word ought to be intreated: Thirdly, what vertue this word hath: Fourthly, how farre the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this word, doth extend it Å¿elfe: And laÅ¿t of all, to whom the word ought to be directed, and pronounced: In all theÅ¿e particulars, wee are as farre aÅ¿under, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee Å¿eemed to agree in the generall.</p>
            <p>I leaue to meddle with any other Å¿ect,
<note place="margin">What wee meane by the word in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> but will deale with the PapiÅ¿ts onely, becauÅ¿e we haue moÅ¿t to do with them: And firÅ¿t of all we are to vnderÅ¿tand, what wee meane by the word, &amp; what they meane by it. We by the word (as I haue Å¿aid) vnderÅ¿tand the whole inÅ¿titution of Chr. IeÅ¿us, whatÅ¿oeuer he Å¿aid, or did, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>manded to bee done, without adding, or diminiÅ¿hing, or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the meaning, or Å¿enÅ¿e of the word: This we mean by the word in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:20181:70"/>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">What the PapiÅ¿ts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand by the word in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> what vnderÅ¿tand the PapiÅ¿ts by the word? They preach not the inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, nor take the whole inÅ¿titution, as he left it. But in place thereof, they Å¿elect, and chuÅ¿e out of his inÅ¿titution, foure, or fiue words, &amp; they make the whole vertue of the inÅ¿titution, to conÅ¿iÅ¿t in the foure, or fiue words. And it were nothing, if they would content themÅ¿elues with theÅ¿e words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they are the words of the inÅ¿titution. But they adde to the words, they take from the words, &amp; alter the meaning of the Å¿ame words, at their pleaÅ¿ure. That yee may knowe this; In their MaÅ¿Å¿e, which they call the Lords Supper, I will let you Å¿ee the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of it: I will diuide their MaÅ¿Å¿e, into Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall, &amp; accidentall things. To the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the MaÅ¿Å¿e, there are three things required. There muÅ¿t of necesÅ¿itie be a prieÅ¿t .i. Å¿uch a one, as takes vpon him the office of our Mediator, Chr. IeÅ¿. to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede between God, &amp; man. Secondly, to the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the MaÅ¿Å¿e, is required, that the PrieÅ¿t offer the bodie, and blood of ChriÅ¿t. We come here to receiue the Å¿ame things: There the prieÅ¿t offers them to God the father. Thirdly, by this worke (Å¿ay they) they obtaine al good things: by
<pb facs="tcp:20181:71"/>this work wrought, they obtaine remisÅ¿ion of Å¿innes, as well to the dead, as to the quicke; but in Å¿peciall, they obtaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misÅ¿ion of Å¿innes to the prieÅ¿t, who is the diÅ¿tributer, and to him, to whom, the prieÅ¿t applieth that Å¿acrifice: And as for the reÅ¿t of the Church who are abÅ¿ent, they obtaine this remisÅ¿ion of their Å¿innes, by this work generally. TheÅ¿e three things are neceÅ¿Å¿arie, to the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the MaÅ¿Å¿e: As for the accidents, that muÅ¿t concurre to the making of a MaÅ¿Å¿e, They are of two Å¿orts: Some of them are alwaies neceÅ¿Å¿arie, without the which, that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot bee: againe, Å¿ome are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arie, and the action may bee without them, but not without a deadlie Å¿inne: TheÅ¿e things that are neceÅ¿Å¿arie, concerne partly the prieÅ¿t, and partly the action it Å¿elfe. The accidents that are neceÅ¿Å¿arie to the prieÅ¿t, are of two Å¿orts: One Å¿ort are Å¿uch, as without the which, hee cannot be a prieÅ¿t; The other Å¿ort Å¿uch, without the which, hee cannot bee free from deadly Å¿in. The things without the which he can not be a prieÅ¿t, are theÅ¿e: Except he haue a power giuen of his BiÅ¿hop to conÅ¿ecrate, which power is iuÅ¿tified by the vnction, &amp;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20181:71"/>Å¿hauing of his crowne: Except again, he haue power to Å¿peake, and that the roofe of his mouth be whole, that he may Å¿peak, hee cannot bee a prieÅ¿t: TheÅ¿e two are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies neceÅ¿Å¿arie, and concurre to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on. Other things againe, are not Å¿o neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arie; as, that the prieÅ¿t muÅ¿t be free from Å¿uÅ¿penÅ¿ion, from curÅ¿ing, deadly Å¿inne, and all EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall pain, &amp; cenÅ¿ures. TheÅ¿e things are neceÅ¿Å¿arie to the perÅ¿on. There are again, two things neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: One Å¿ort, without the which the action cannot bee; without the Lords prayer it cannot bee, without the fiue words of the inÅ¿titution, it cannot bee: Other things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, are not Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arie; as, the conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the place, where the MaÅ¿Å¿e is Å¿aid, The Altar Å¿tone, The blesÅ¿ing of the Chalice, The water, The Å¿inging, he that Å¿hould helpe to Å¿ay MaÅ¿Å¿e, and the reÅ¿t. So they and wee, in no Å¿ort agree concerning the word, what is meant by it. The Å¿econd point is, how this word ought to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wherein wee are as farre aÅ¿under: we Å¿ay, the word taken as hath beene Å¿aid, for the whole inÅ¿titution, ought to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, after this manner. FirÅ¿t, there ought to be a lawfull paÅ¿tor, who hath his calling
<pb facs="tcp:20181:72"/>of God, to deliuer it. And this paÅ¿tor ought to deliuer the word lawfully; what is that? hee ought to preach it, to proclaime it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, with a plaine Å¿peech to denounce it: hee ought to open vp, and declare, all the parts of it, what is the peoples part, and what is his owne part, how he ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer, and diÅ¿tribute that bread, and that wine, how the people ought to receiue, at his hands, that bread, and that wine, to informe their faith, how they ought to receiue ChriÅ¿ts bodie, and bloud, Å¿ignified by that bread, and that wine. As alÅ¿o, hee ought to teach them, how they Å¿huld come with reuerence, vnto that Table, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the pretious bodie, and blood of ChriÅ¿t: This hee ought to doe, in a familiar language, that the people may vnderÅ¿tand him, that they may heare him, that they may perceiue, and lay vp in their hearts, the things that hee Å¿peakes. For what auaileth it you, to heare a thing whiÅ¿pered, and not Å¿poken out: or if it be Å¿poken out, what auaileth it you to heare it, if yee vnderÅ¿tand it not? For, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee heare ChriÅ¿t, in a familiar, and plaine language, yee cannot vnderÅ¿tand: and except ye vnderÅ¿tand, it is imposÅ¿ible
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20181:72"/>for you to beleeue: and without beleefe, there is no application of ChriÅ¿t: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee beleeue, and apply ChriÅ¿t to your Å¿elues, your comming to the Sacrament is in vaine. So of necesÅ¿itie, if this Sacrament be lawfully handled, The paÅ¿tor muÅ¿t preach the inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, that it may be heard; and in a familiar language, that it may be vnderÅ¿tood, in Å¿uch Å¿ort that the faithfull people may be informed how to receiue, and the MiniÅ¿ter may knowe his part, how to deliuer, and diÅ¿tribute. This I Å¿ay, Å¿hould bee the right handling of the holy inÅ¿titution of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now what do they? in place of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter, paÅ¿tor, or BiÅ¿hoppe (call him as you pleaÅ¿e) who is lawfully called of God; they Å¿ubÅ¿titute a prieÅ¿t, Å¿urrogate an hierling, who hath no calling, or office now, in the church of God. For the office of a prieÅ¿t, as they vÅ¿e their prieÅ¿thoode, is no other thing, but the office of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, the office of the Mediator, betwixt God and vs: for they make their prieÅ¿ts dailie to offer vppe ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now this is the Mediator, Chr. his office, that he did it, once for all, once for euer, Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle: Å¿o that they haue no
<pb facs="tcp:20181:73"/>entrance, to doe this ouer againe: And in reÅ¿pect, that their prieÅ¿ts do this againe, which ChriÅ¿t hath done alreadie, they doe it without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mand, they haue no warrant in the word of God. And if they had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for their calling, in the word of God, yet they handle the Sacrament amiÅ¿Å¿e: for whereas they Å¿hould Å¿peake forth cleerely, they whiÅ¿per, and they coniure the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by a certaine kind of whiÅ¿pering. Wheras they Å¿hould Å¿peake it, in a knowen language, that the people may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand; They Å¿peake, in an vnknowen lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and though they Å¿pake it, in a known &amp; familiar tongue, yet in that they whiÅ¿per it, the people cannot be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And what Å¿hall I Å¿ay? Seeing they thus handle the word, though it be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in Å¿titution it Å¿elfe, yet they Å¿o Å¿poile it, in the handling, that it is not a holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then wee differ as much in the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poynt, how that word ought to bee handled, and intreated.</p>
            <p>Now the third point is,
<note place="margin">The third head in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie.</note> what vertue this word hath, how farre the vertue of this word extendeth it Å¿elfe: In this point, we grant &amp; acknowledge, that the word hath a vertue: and the word taken, as hath bin
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20181:73"/>Å¿aid, worketh Å¿omewhat, euen towards the Å¿ame elements, of bread, and wine; for wee acknowledge, that thoÅ¿e elements, by the vertue of this word, are changed, not in their Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and naturall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But wee grant, that the elements are changed, in a quality which they had not before; In Å¿uch Å¿ort, that theÅ¿e elements, are taken from the common vÅ¿e, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they Å¿erued before, and by the inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of ChriÅ¿t, they are applied vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other holy vÅ¿e. Marke, how farre the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vÅ¿e differs from the common vÅ¿e, there is as great difference, betwixt the elements, this day in the action, and the thing that they were yeÅ¿terday: For I grant, that the elements are changed; &amp; yet this change, proceedeth not, of the nature of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from an incloÅ¿ed vertue, Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to bee in the words, nor from the whiÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the words: but it proceeds, from the will of ChriÅ¿t, from the ordinance, &amp; appointment of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿et downe in his owne inÅ¿titution: for that thing is holy, which God calleth holy; and that thing is profane, which God calleth profane.</p>
            <p>To let you vnderÅ¿tand, how theÅ¿e Å¿ignes are made holy, it is neceÅ¿Å¿arie, that theÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:20181:74"/>two things bee conÅ¿idered.
<note place="margin">How the elements are Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> FirÅ¿t, what hee is that makes them holy, whether God, Angell, or man. Secondly, whoeuer he bee, that maketh them holy, by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; way, he maketh them holy. And by the conÅ¿ideration of theÅ¿e two, wee Å¿hall come to the conÅ¿ideration, and right view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Å¿anctification of the Elements.</p>
            <p>For the FirÅ¿t, wee Å¿ay, that God is onely hee, that may make a thing which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to be holy. So we Å¿ay, that God by his will and ordinance, declared, and Å¿et downe, in his word, hath made the things, that were common, by his appoyntment to bee holy. As for the way, and meanes whereby they are made holy, it is the word of God, the inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, the will of ChriÅ¿t, declared in his inÅ¿titution, that maketh them holy. For the preaching, and opening of the word, and inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, letteth vs Å¿ee, that god hath made theÅ¿e things holy: and not onely, that hee hath made them holy, but let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs Å¿ee an holy manner, how they Å¿hould be vÅ¿ed, in what place, at what time with what heart, &amp; to what end. So it is the wil of ChriÅ¿t, declared in his inÅ¿titution, wherby the things that were common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are now made holy. There are two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20181:74"/>things alÅ¿o, which make the Å¿ame ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, holy: &amp; theÅ¿e two, are vÅ¿ed in this inÅ¿titution. There is praier, &amp; thankÅ¿giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which make the creatures of God to our vÅ¿e, holy: whereas otherwiÅ¿e, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the good creatures of God, like dogs, &amp; thank him not for them, it is a Å¿ure token that they were neuer Å¿anctified to our vÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>By prayer we obtaine grace, &amp; Å¿trength from God, to vÅ¿e the creatures, and this whole action, holily &amp; lawfully, as it Å¿hold be. And therefore not onely, in this holy action, Å¿hould we begin with God, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of his name, but in all actions in the world, we Å¿hould begin in the name of God. So it is the wil of God, praier, and thankÅ¿giuing, conioined with the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts, that make them holy. All theÅ¿e three, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the action of the Lords Supper, make the Seales holy: For, beÅ¿ide the wil of God, declared in the inÅ¿titution, In the Lords Supper, we vÅ¿e inuocation; and in this inuocation, we vÅ¿e thankeÅ¿giuing. The elements are not made holy, by the word of God onely, but by the vÅ¿e of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>kÅ¿giuing, which three, are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means, wherby theÅ¿e things are Å¿a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ctified.</p>
            <p>Now, to expreÅ¿Å¿e, and laie-foorth,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:75"/>the Å¿anctification of the Elements:
<note place="margin">The word of bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing and thankÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing vÅ¿ed indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, the one expreÅ¿Å¿ed by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> The EuangeliÅ¿ts, and the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul,</hi> vÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently the word, <hi>To bleÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and <hi>to giue thankes,</hi> and commonly they put, the one for the other: For yee may Å¿ee, that <hi>Marke,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> vÅ¿e the word <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿e: Mathew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> vÅ¿e the word <hi>to giue thankes,</hi> and all in one Å¿ignification: And <hi>Marke</hi> himÅ¿elfe in the 14. of his GoÅ¿pell, 22. verÅ¿e, Å¿peaking of the Å¿ame action of the Lords Supper, vÅ¿eth the word to <hi>BleÅ¿s,</hi> and in the 23. verÅ¿e, he vÅ¿eth the word to <hi>Giue thanks,</hi> and both in one Å¿ignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to let you Å¿ee, that the ApoÅ¿tle, ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, and the EuangiliÅ¿ts, vÅ¿e the word to <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and to <hi>Giue thankes,</hi> indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Å¿ignifie the Å¿anctification, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ecration of the elements. Except, ye take the one for the other, it will bee hard to gather anie good meaning out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles words: for I remember the ApoÅ¿tle, 1. Corin. 10.16. Å¿ayth: <hi>The Cup of bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing, which we bleÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> what is that? I take the word to Å¿ignifie, as I haue Å¿aid, <hi>which wee bleÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> that is, which wee Å¿anctifie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare by blesÅ¿ing. So, to bleÅ¿Å¿e, and to giue thankes in the Lords Supper, Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no other thing, but to Å¿anctifie: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20181:75"/>if ye take the word, in another Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yee Å¿hall fall into an error: and and why? God is Å¿ayde to bleÅ¿Å¿e, and man is Å¿aid to bleÅ¿Å¿e: God is Å¿aid to bleÅ¿Å¿e, when hee giueth good things vnto his creatures, for Gods blesÅ¿ing is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer effectuall; and therefore hee is Å¿aid to bleÅ¿Å¿e, when he giueth good things. Man againe, is Å¿aid to bleÅ¿Å¿e either priuately, or publikely, when hee craueth blesÅ¿ing, at the hands of God, to anie man; when hee bleÅ¿Å¿eth, in the name, and at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, anie perÅ¿on, or people: Now, if yee aÅ¿cribe blesÅ¿ing, in any of theÅ¿e two Å¿ignifications to the cuppe, it is amiÅ¿Å¿e: for wee vÅ¿e neyther to craue a blesÅ¿ing, to inÅ¿enÅ¿ible elements; nor yet to bleÅ¿Å¿e them, in the name of God: And God vÅ¿eth to giue good things, to the Å¿onnes of men, and not to inÅ¿enÅ¿ible creatures: Therefore we muÅ¿t needes vÅ¿e the word, <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> in the third Å¿ignification. <hi>The cuppe of blesÅ¿ing, which wee bleÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> that is, which wee Å¿anctifie, and prepare by blesÅ¿ing: Thus farre wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand, for the Å¿anctification of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements.</p>
            <p>Now let vs Å¿ee, how they Å¿anctifie the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:76"/>elements, &amp; what is the forme of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ecration, Å¿o far as I vnderÅ¿tand of it, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿teth in theÅ¿e fiue words: <hi>Hoc eÅ¿t enim corpus meum:</hi> It Å¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth in theÅ¿e fiue words, and in the whiÅ¿pering of them; for if you whiÅ¿per them not, ye loÅ¿e the faÅ¿hion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation: for the thing which we call Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, they call whiÅ¿pering: And the whiÅ¿pering of thoÅ¿e fiue words, they call the conÅ¿ecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the elements: And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the words are after this manner whiÅ¿pered, they preÅ¿uppoÅ¿e, Å¿uch a Å¿ecret, &amp; mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿trous vertue, to be incloÅ¿ed in the Å¿yllables, That the vertue, &amp; power which floweth from the words, is able to chaÅ¿e away wholly, the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the bread, Å¿o that the very bread, &amp; Å¿ubÅ¿tance of it, is altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troied, by this power: Secondly, that this power which floweth from theÅ¿e words, is able to fetch, &amp; pull downe an otherÅ¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, to wit, the fleÅ¿h, &amp; blood of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, that fitteth at the right hand of his father, &amp; is able to put it within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿e of that bread: This is a Å¿trange and a great vertue, that, not only wil ouerthrowe that Å¿ubÅ¿tance, but put it within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿e of that bread. The Å¿ame fiue words, whiÅ¿pered in this maner, haue Å¿uch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trous
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20181:76"/>operation, Å¿ay they, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both to chaÅ¿e a way the one Å¿ubÅ¿tance, to pull downe an other, and to put it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaÅ¿Å¿e of that bread. We altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their denie, That there is Å¿uch a vertue in theÅ¿e words: for, as I haue Å¿aid before, wee denie not, that the word hath a vertue, but denie that there is Å¿uch a vertue incloÅ¿ed in the words; wee denie the qualitie of the vertue, or that it floweth, from Å¿uch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. For, we grant, that the word hath a vertue; there is neuer a word, that God Å¿peaketh heere, but it hath a vertue ioyned withit: but wee deny, that this vertue is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloÅ¿ed in the Å¿yllables, in the whiÅ¿pering, or pronouncing of the words: for if there were Å¿uch avertue, and power incloÅ¿ed in the Å¿yllables, by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on it Å¿hould follow, that there were avertue in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and Å¿hape of the letter, that makes vp thewords. Now, there is noman wil think that there is any vertue in the figure, or Å¿hape of the letter: and there is as little vertue in the Å¿yllables or pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the words themÅ¿elues. So wee denie, that there is anie vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloÅ¿ed in the Å¿yllables, or reÅ¿ident in the word. But wee Å¿ay, that there is
<pb facs="tcp:20181:77"/>a power conioyned with the word, and this power is not reÅ¿ident in the word, but is reÅ¿ident, in the eternal word, in the eÅ¿Å¿ential Word wherof <hi>Iohn</hi> the EuangeliÅ¿t makes mention. Cap. 1. <hi>The word which was from the beginning,</hi> that is, the Å¿onne of God ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us: wee Å¿ay, there is not a dram weight of this vertue, and power reÅ¿ident in any creature that euer God created, but it is onely reÅ¿ident in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us: And therefore there floweth no vertue from the Å¿illables, nor from the words that are Å¿poken, but from ChriÅ¿t, and his Å¿pirit, who giues the vertue to thoÅ¿e words. So wee differ in this; we Å¿ay that there is not anie vertue reÅ¿ident in the Å¿illables, wee Å¿ay that the Å¿illables, and pronouncing of the Å¿illables, work nothing: but wee Å¿ay that the vertue is reÅ¿ident in the perÅ¿on of the Å¿onne of God, and heeworkes by his owne word.</p>
            <p>Now wee Å¿ay that there cannot be Å¿uch a monÅ¿trous change, as to Å¿ay the whiÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Å¿o manie wordes, Å¿hould change the owne Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the bread, pull down the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, and put his bodie in Å¿o narrow a compaÅ¿Å¿e, wee Å¿ay that cannot bee. And this I Å¿hall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20181:77"/>proue by theÅ¿e three rules; namely,
<note place="margin">Refutation of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ubÅ¿tantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by 3. Å¿orts of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</note> By the veritie of the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us; By the articles of our Beliefe; And by the true end of the inÅ¿titution of this Sacrament. And Å¿o we Å¿hall Å¿ee, by Gods grace, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite abÅ¿urdities that follow vpon their opinion.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t principle that I lay, is this;
<note place="margin">The firÅ¿t Å¿ort of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, the Sonne of GOD, in the time appointed, tooke true fleÅ¿h of the wombe of the Virgin, and vnited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe with our nature in one perÅ¿onall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to the end that our nature, which fell altogether from integritie in the firÅ¿t <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> might recouer the Å¿ame in the Å¿econd <hi>Adam:</hi> yea, not onely the Å¿ame, but Å¿o much the greater, as our Å¿econd <hi>Adam</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells the firÅ¿t in all de grees: And in reÅ¿pect hee tooke on him a body, like vnto ours in all things (Å¿inne excepted) of neceÅ¿sity it muÅ¿t follow, that the definition of a true body, and the inÅ¿eparable properties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, muÅ¿t be competent to him. But theÅ¿e are the inÅ¿eparable properties; namely, to be in one certaine place, to be finite, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿cribed, viÅ¿ible, and palpable: for all theÅ¿e concurre (<hi>quarto modo,</hi> as the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians Å¿ay) to a body; Å¿o that they cannot
<pb facs="tcp:20181:78"/>be Å¿eparate from the Å¿ubiect, without the diÅ¿traction thereof. Then TreaÅ¿on on this manner; <hi>A true humane body, is in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place; ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us body, is a true, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body: therefore it is in a certaine place.</hi> I call a place, a certaine condition of an inÅ¿trumentall bodie, whereby it commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, that where-euer the body be, of neceÅ¿sitie, it is limited within that place; and vvhile it is there, it cannot bee elÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>If you would haue the probation of my PropoÅ¿ition from the Doctors, read <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guÅ¿tine</hi> to <hi>Dardanus,</hi> Å¿peaking of this Å¿ame body of ChriÅ¿t. Take avvay a certaine roome from the bodies, and they Å¿hall be in no place; and if they be in no place, they are not. The Å¿ame <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> writing vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his 30. TreatiÅ¿e, Å¿aith, The body in the which the Lord did ariÅ¿e, of neceÅ¿sity muÅ¿t be in a place; but his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine efficacie and nature, is diffuÅ¿ed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. And in his third EpiÅ¿tle, he Å¿aith, How much Å¿oeuer the body be, or how little Å¿oeuer the body be, it behoues to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the bounds of a place. And, beÅ¿ides theÅ¿e, the hiÅ¿tory of the <hi>Acts</hi> proueth moÅ¿t euidently ChriÅ¿t his body to be in a certain
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20181:78"/>place: as <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. the words are theÅ¿e; <hi>Whom the heauens muÅ¿t containe, vntill the time that all things be reÅ¿tored, vvhich God had Å¿poken by the mouth of all his holie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Though I need not to inÅ¿iÅ¿t in the probation of theÅ¿e things, yet I proceede. Secondly then I reaÅ¿on after this manner; A humane body is finite, and circumÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; but the body of ChriÅ¿t is a humane body. What warrant from the Doctors haue I for this? I leaue many purpoÅ¿ely, &amp; will alleage onely <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> who writing to <hi>Dardanus, Belieue</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>ChriÅ¿t to be euery where, in that he is God; but onely to be in heauen, according to the nature of a true body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in his 146. EpiÅ¿tle, <hi>I belieue,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>the body of ChriÅ¿t to be Å¿o in heauen, as it vvas on the earth, vvhen hee vvent vp to heauen.</hi> But it was circumÅ¿cribed in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place on the earth. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is Å¿o in the heauen. And conÅ¿equently, it cannot be in the MaÅ¿Å¿e-bread, and in heauen both at one time. The laÅ¿t reaÅ¿on is this: A humane bodie is viÅ¿ible, and palpable; but ChriÅ¿t hath a humane body, and hee is corporally preÅ¿ent, as they Å¿ay: therefore ChriÅ¿t his body is viÅ¿ible, and palpable.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:79"/>
            <p>I proue my PropoÅ¿ition, by ChriÅ¿t his owne words, taken out of <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. In the which place, to perÅ¿wade the ApoÅ¿tles of the verity of his body, and to proue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, that it was not fantaÅ¿ticall, heev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth the argument taken from theÅ¿e tvvo qualities, and he commands his ApoÅ¿tles to feele, and Å¿ee; giuing them thereby to vnderÅ¿tand, that as theÅ¿e two Å¿enÅ¿es are the moÅ¿t certaine of all the reÅ¿t: Å¿o are they moÅ¿t able to diÅ¿cerne, whether hee was a body, or a Å¿pirit. As if he would haue Å¿aid, If I be viÅ¿ible, and palpable, ye may be out of doubt that I haue a true body. For as the Poet Å¿aith, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> citeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o to this Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e; <hi>Tangere enim, et tangi, niÅ¿i corpus, nulla poteÅ¿tres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theÅ¿e arguments, it may be euidently Å¿een, how this TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation, may no way Å¿tand with the verity of the bodie of Chr. IeÅ¿us: And as it fights with the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us; Å¿o it repugnes directly, the articles of our faith. For, in our Beliefe, we profeÅ¿Å¿e,
<note place="margin">Second Å¿ort of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t.</note> that ChriÅ¿t aÅ¿cended out of this earth, to the heauen, where hee Å¿its at the right hand of the Father, vvhere hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerns, and directs all things in heauen and earth; from the which place, he is to come
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20181:79"/>at the laÅ¿t day, to iudge the world.</p>
            <p>This article teacheth vs, that hee hath changed his dwelling vvhich hee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t vs, on the earth, and is aÅ¿cended into the heauens, where he Å¿its at the right hand of his Father, and Å¿hall remaine there (according to the teÅ¿timony of <hi>Peter,</hi> which I cited out of the <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21.) vntill the laÅ¿t day. If hee Å¿it at his Fathers right hand, and be to remaine in heauen vntill the laÅ¿t day, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is he not corporally in the bread. But the article of our Beliefe, Å¿aith, That he Å¿itteth at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿aith in that place, that the heauens muÅ¿t containe him vntill the laÅ¿t day. Therefore, this TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation, is directly againÅ¿t the articles of our Beliefe, &amp; the manifeÅ¿t place of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is oppoÅ¿ite vnto the end,
<note place="margin">Third Å¿ort of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t.</note> wherefore this Sacrament was inÅ¿tituted, &amp; this is moÅ¿t euident: for the end of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is Å¿pirituall, as the effect that floweth thereof, is Å¿piritual, and the inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby this Å¿pirituall food is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to vs, is alÅ¿o Å¿piritual. But from a naturall, and corporall preÅ¿ence, a Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all effect can neuer flowe: therefore the corporall, and naturall preÅ¿ence of the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:80"/>body and bloud of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, repugnes directly the end of this Sacrament: for the corporall preÅ¿ence, muÅ¿t haue a corporall eating: of this eating, followeth a digeÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Å¿tomacke: and the thing that is digeÅ¿ted in the Å¿tomack, is neuer able to feed my Å¿oule to life eternall. So this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall preÅ¿ence, muÅ¿t euer tend to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall end; which is directly contrarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end wherefore this Sacrament was inÅ¿tituted.</p>
            <p>Further,
<note place="margin">Other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto the Å¿ame effect.</note> if the bread were tranÅ¿ubÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, it Å¿hould become the thing Å¿ignified; if it become the thing Å¿ignified, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Å¿hould want a Å¿igne, and Å¿o it Å¿hould not be a Sacrament: for euery Sacrament, as yee haue heard, is a Å¿igne. Now, to Å¿ay that the accidents of true bread, as the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the roundneÅ¿Å¿e of it, that they may Å¿erue as Å¿ignes, that is more then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for, between the Å¿igne, and the thing Å¿ignified, there muÅ¿t be a conformity: but there is no conformity between the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and the body and bloud of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us. For if that were Å¿o, the accidents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed to nouriÅ¿h vs corporally; as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, is appointed to nouriÅ¿h vs Å¿piritually.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:20181:80"/>
            <p>Againe, if the bread become the body and bloud of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, it Å¿hould follow, that he had a body without bloud; for hee hath inÅ¿tituted another Å¿igne beÅ¿ides, to repreÅ¿ent his bloud. AlÅ¿o, if there had been Å¿uch a wonderfull thing as they Å¿peak of, in this Sacrament, there would haue been plaine mention made thereof in the Scripture: for, God himÅ¿elfe works neuer a notable worke, but he declares it, either openly, or more Å¿ecretly in the Scripture, that thereby hee may be glorified in his wonderfull works. As yee may read in the EuangeliÅ¿t <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ohn,</hi> 2.8. where the vvater was changed into wine; <hi>Gene.</hi> 2.22. where the rib of <hi>Adam,</hi> was changed into <hi>Heua: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> 7.10. where <hi>Aarons</hi> rodde was turned into a Serpent: there ye Å¿ee, that changing is manifeÅ¿tly expreÅ¿Å¿ed. Therefore I Å¿ay, if there had bin Å¿uch a monÅ¿trous change in theÅ¿e eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts of the Supper as they affirm, the Scripture would not haue concealed it, but expreÅ¿Å¿ed it: but in reÅ¿pect there is no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tion made of this change in the Script. therfore there is no Å¿uch change in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Further, if there were Å¿uch a change, as they Å¿ay, either it is before theÅ¿e words of conÅ¿ecration be Å¿poken, or followes after
<pb facs="tcp:20181:81"/>the Å¿ame words be Å¿poken. If the change be before the words of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ecration be Å¿poken, the conÅ¿ecration is Å¿uperfluous, &amp; their PropoÅ¿ition is falÅ¿e: if the change be after the words be Å¿poken, <hi>This bread is my body,</hi> their PropoÅ¿ition is falÅ¿e alÅ¿o; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the word <hi>bread,</hi> is Å¿poken, before the laÅ¿t Å¿yllable of their fiue words is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. TheÅ¿e, and infinite moe abÅ¿urdities, follow of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>And yet they obÅ¿tinately perÅ¿euer, and vrge vs with the letter, affirming that the words of ChriÅ¿t are Å¿o plaine, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no figure. They would haue Å¿poken more aduiÅ¿edly, if they had Å¿ought coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell of <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> to haue diÅ¿cerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a figuratiue Å¿peech, and a proper Å¿peech: for he, in his third booke, and 16. chapter of ChriÅ¿tian doctrine, Å¿peakes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Å¿ort; <hi>If the Å¿peech,</hi> Å¿aith hee, <hi>Å¿eeme to commaund a vvickedneÅ¿s, or miÅ¿cheife, on to forbid any happineÅ¿Å¿e, or any vvelfare, it is not proper, it is then figuratiue.</hi> And he adds for an example, a place out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except,</hi> Å¿aith our Sauiour, <hi>ye eate the fleÅ¿h of the Å¿onne of man, and drinke his bloud, yee haue no life in you.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Augustine</hi> addeth: <hi>This Å¿peech,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>Å¿esmeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20181:81"/>a miÅ¿chiefe; therefore it is a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Å¿peech;</hi> vvhereby wee are commanded to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>municate with the Å¿ufferings of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, and with gladnes to keepe in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall memory, that the fleÅ¿h of the Lord, was crucified, and wounded for vs. For, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e, it were more horrible (as the Å¿ame <hi>AuguÅ¿tine</hi> maketh mention in the Å¿econd booke againÅ¿t the AduerÅ¿aries of the lavv) to eate the fleÅ¿h of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us really, then to murther him; and more horrible to drinke his bloud, then to Å¿hed his bloud. Yet notwithÅ¿tanding, they are not aÅ¿hamed Å¿till to hold &amp; maintaine, that thoÅ¿e words ought to be taken properly. So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that of very malice, for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction Å¿ake, to the end onely that they may withÅ¿tand the truth, they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be a Å¿acrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tall Å¿peech. For they are compelled, will they, nill they, in other Å¿peeches of the like Å¿ort, to acknowledge a figure: as, <hi>GeneÅ¿.</hi> 17.10. CircumciÅ¿ion is called the Couenant; and <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. the Lamb is called the PaÅ¿s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer; and <hi>Math.</hi> 20.22. the Cup is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Bloud; and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. the Cup is called the new TeÅ¿tament; and 1. Cor. 10.4. the Rock is called ChriÅ¿t. All theÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:20181:82"/>Å¿peeches are Å¿acramentall, and receiue a kinde of interpretation: yet they malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly preaÅ¿e to deny vs this, in theÅ¿e words <hi>(Hoc eÅ¿t corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>)</hi> which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to grant, in the reÅ¿t, as eÅ¿pecially, where <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the rock, ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Now, when they are driuen out of this FortreÅ¿Å¿e, they flie as vnhappily to the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: namely, That God by his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, may make the body of ChriÅ¿t, both to be in heauen, &amp; in the bread, both at one time. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Å¿ay they, It is Å¿o. If I denyed their conÅ¿equent, they would bee much troubled to prooue it. But the queÅ¿tion Å¿tandeth not heere, Whether God may do it, or not: but the queÅ¿tion is, Whether God will it, or not; or may will it, or not. And we Å¿ay reuerently, that his MaieÅ¿tie may not will it: for, though it be true, that hee may many things which hee will not, yet it is as true, that there are many things, vvhich hee may not will; of the which Å¿ort this is: and theÅ¿e are reduced to two Å¿orts.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, hee may not will thoÅ¿e things vvhich are contrarie to his nature: as to be changeable; as to decay; and Å¿uch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for, if hee might will theÅ¿e things,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20181:82"/>they Å¿hould not be arguments of any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿Å¿ance, or of any power; but rather, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine arguments of his impotencie, and infirmitie. And therefore, though hee may not will theÅ¿e things, hee ceaÅ¿eth not to be omnipotent; but Å¿o much the rather, his conÅ¿tant and inuincible power is knowen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, GOD may not vvill Å¿ome things, by reaÅ¿on of a preÅ¿uppoÅ¿ed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: as, Å¿uch things, whereof hee hath concluded the contrarie before; of the vvhich Å¿ort, is this, which is now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. For, Å¿eeing that GOD hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that a humane bodie, Å¿hould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t of inÅ¿trumentall parts, and therefore to be comprehended, and circumÅ¿cribed within one, &amp; the owne proper place: and alÅ¿o, Å¿eeing hee hath appointed ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us to haue the like bodie; and that, not for a time, but eternally: in reÅ¿pect of this determined will (I Å¿ay) God may not will the contrarie, now; either to aboliÅ¿h this bodie, which he hath appointed to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or yet to make it at one time, in reÅ¿pect of one thing, a body, &amp; not a body, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, &amp; not quantified, finite, and infinite, locall, &amp; not locall: for to wil theÅ¿e things,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:83"/>which are plaine contrary in themÅ¿elues, he may not, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> it is poÅ¿sible for him to will a lye. So, it may be Å¿eene of all men, that wee preÅ¿erue the omnipotencie of God; &amp; with reuerence from our harts, acknowledge him onely, to be onely om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent: and we deÅ¿ire all men, to eÅ¿teem them as Calumniators, who abuÅ¿e the eares of the Å¿imple ones, to perÅ¿wade them the contrary of vs.</p>
            <p>They are not content with this: but they Å¿ay, That God may will a contradiction, &amp; make both the parts to be true at one time. And to proue this, they wold bring in the Miracles which God works: as if they wold Å¿ay, Euery Miracle includes a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for example; God made a Virgine to beare a Å¿onne, they thinke this vvorke brings with it a contradiction. To beare a Å¿onne, Å¿ay they, is the one part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; and to be a virgine, is the other part of the contradiction. This worke is a miracle, but it implieth no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for, concerning the holy virgins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, therein is no contradiction. There was a miracle indeed, that a virgine Å¿hould beare a Å¿on, contrary to the courÅ¿e of nature: for, to be a virgine, and yet to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20181:83"/>haue a child, are not contradictory, if Å¿hee haue conceiued, and brought forth by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, as did the bleÅ¿Å¿ed virgin: But to be a virgine, and not a virgine, at one time, this is the contradiction. So ChriÅ¿t his body, to be viÅ¿ible and inuiÅ¿ible, locall and not locall, at one time, is in euery reÅ¿pect the like contradiction; and therefore impoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible to be true.</p>
            <p>Their other example, of ChriÅ¿t his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in, the doores beeing cloÅ¿ed, and Å¿hut, vvhat appearance of contradiction hath it? Can they proue that hee entred through the doores? And if he did, then was there an alteration of qualities, &amp; that by miracle, either in ChriÅ¿t his body, or in the doores; but no contradiction in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vnleÅ¿Å¿e you knowe not what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is.</p>
            <p>Their third and laÅ¿t example, of the fire in <hi>Nabuchadnezzers</hi> Ouen, which conÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the miniÅ¿ters, but hurt not them that were in the midÅ¿t of it, appeares to be of no weight, by that which hath already beene anÅ¿wered. They imagine, as appeareth, that in euery miracle, a contradiction is implyed: vvhich is abÅ¿urd. If they can proue, that this fire was both hot &amp; cold,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:84"/>then they Å¿ay Å¿omething to the purpoÅ¿e: but that it burnes vp Å¿ome, and hurts not others, is no contradiction; becauÅ¿e by miracle the force therof was repreÅ¿Å¿ed. So this Å¿econd ground is Å¿ure; God may not will that thing, which implyeth a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. But Å¿o it is, that the reall preÅ¿ence of the bodie of ChriÅ¿t in the Sacrament, implyeth a contradiction; for, it makes the body of ChriÅ¿t, viÅ¿ible, and inuiÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; compaÅ¿t, and not compaÅ¿t, at one time: therefore, GOD may not will Å¿uch a thing.</p>
            <p>VVhen they are driuen from this they make their laÅ¿t refuge a peremptorie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in their owne opinion:
<note place="margin">Their laÅ¿t refuge.</note> for, they Å¿ay, ChriÅ¿t his bodie is freed from phyÅ¿icall rules: for, Theologie is not Å¿ubiect to phyÅ¿icall rules. It is a very ill gathered conÅ¿equence, to Å¿ay, that vvee Å¿ubiect Theologie to PhyÅ¿ick, becauÅ¿e that vvee (firÅ¿t, according to Theologie, vvhich is the law of GOD; and next, according to PhyÅ¿icke, vvhich is the law of Nature) defend the naturall properties, of the true, and naturall bodie of ChriÅ¿t Iefus. Then I grant this, that Theologie is not Å¿ubiect vnto PhyÅ¿ick; vvhat of this? <hi>Ergo,</hi> ChriÅ¿t
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20181:84"/>his body is freed from phyÅ¿icall rules. How followes that I pray you? By vvhat law may yee free, or can yee free the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of ChriÅ¿t? By the law of Nature, yee cannot; for hee was made of the Å¿eede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and tooke on him true fleÅ¿h, of the vvombe of the Virgine: And farre leÅ¿Å¿e by the law of GOD, which is Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie: for yee knowe, that ChriÅ¿t was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from all eternitie, to take on him our nature, &amp; to becom true man.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is true, that the law of GOD, cannot be Å¿ubiect to the law of Nature; for the law of Nature, floweth from the law of GOD, as out of the owne Å¿pring: but it is as true, that if yee take ChriÅ¿t his body, from the law of Nature, yee Å¿hall free it alÅ¿o from the law of God. For, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the Scripture, Å¿o conÅ¿ents with the law of Nature, that if yee denie the one, yee Å¿hall denie the other; and if yee admit the one, yee Å¿hall admit alÅ¿o the other. Therefore, if they looke vvell about them, they Å¿hall finde the beame to bee in their ovvne eye: for, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, both the lawe of GOD, and the law of Nature, by a nevv inuented phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ick of their owne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:85"/>
            <p>For, whatÅ¿oeuer he be, that attributes to one, and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame body, naturall, and vnnaturall properties, vvhich directlie fight againÅ¿t themÅ¿elues; I Å¿ay, that man peruerts both true Theology, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ick. But they, to one and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame body of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, attribute naturall, &amp; vnnaturall properties: therefore it is they, that peruert both the vÅ¿e of true Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and the order Å¿et downe, and eÅ¿tabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed in Nature.</p>
            <p>Would you knowe the reaÅ¿on of my PropoÅ¿ition? I Å¿ay, it behoueth as well in Theology, as in PhyÅ¿ick, of neceÅ¿sity, one of the contrary enunciations to be falÅ¿e. But once to make an end vvith them, I will aunÅ¿were their laÅ¿t refuge. Thus they reaÅ¿on; A glorified body, is not Å¿ubiect to phyÅ¿icall rules: but ChriÅ¿t his body is glorified; therfore it is not Å¿ubiect to phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿icall rules. FirÅ¿t of all, before wee anÅ¿wer directly, wee muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider wherein Å¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the glorification of a body, and then the anÅ¿wer will be eaÅ¿ie.</p>
            <p>The ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42. Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth after this manner; <hi>So alÅ¿o,</hi> Å¿aith hee, <hi>is the reÅ¿urrection of the dead. The body is Å¿owen in corruption, and is raiÅ¿ed in incorruption:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20181:85"/>It is Å¿owen in diÅ¿honour, and is raiÅ¿ed in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. It is Å¿owen in weakneÅ¿Å¿e, and is raiÅ¿ed in power.</hi> And a litle after: <hi>This corruption, muÅ¿t put on incorruption, and this mortalitie, muÅ¿t put on immortalitie.</hi> By this cleare <hi>Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿is, Paul</hi> plainly deÅ¿cribeth the glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a bodie; for he oppoÅ¿eth theÅ¿e two, the vnglorified, and the glorified bodie: And to the vnglorified bodie, hee aÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth corruption, ignominie, infirmitie, carnalitie, and mortalitie: To the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied bodie, hee attributes incorruption, glorie, power, Å¿piritualitie and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: Of this oppoÅ¿ition, we may gather eaÅ¿ily, what the reÅ¿urrection, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, brings to the bodie. In a word, by them, wee Å¿ee, That the bodie is onely Å¿poyled of corruption, Å¿hame, infirmitie, naturalitie, and mortalitie. And it becomes onely Å¿poyled of all the infirmities of our nature, that it may be clothed, with a more glorious apparell: as, with incorruption, power, glorie, Å¿piritualitie, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Wee Å¿ee then, That this glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on imports a chaunge indeed; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue no man will bee Å¿o mad, as to thinke this change to bee made in the Å¿ubÅ¿tance: for if that were Å¿o, the old Å¿ubÅ¿tance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed
<pb facs="tcp:20181:86"/>to decay, and a new Å¿hould ariÅ¿e: but wee heere no Å¿uch thing in this diÅ¿cription, and as little is the change made in the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie: for wee find no word, eyther of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, or diminution of any Å¿ubÅ¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce, which behoued to be, if it were in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: The moÅ¿t that we can perceiue, This mutation conÅ¿iÅ¿tes in the qualities, by the which, the bodie caÅ¿teth off the old coate of infirmitie, and cloatheth it Å¿elfe, with the coate of glorie: for ChriÅ¿t after hee did ariÅ¿e, hee both went, and came, was Å¿eene, and touched. Of the things before deduced, it cleerely followeth, That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect the glorie of the bodie of ChriÅ¿t, hath wrought nothing in his nature, and Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, and conÅ¿equently in his naturall dimenÅ¿ions, neyther yet in any other eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿entiall propertie, That therefore the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of his bodie, freeth it not, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the rules of PhyÅ¿ick: For, Å¿o long, as that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a true bodie remaines, there are no Å¿upernaturall gifts, whereby it may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, were they neuer Å¿o high, Å¿o farre as they may be gathered out of the Å¿criptures, that may hurt eyther the nature, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall propertie of it: For there is no gift nor qualitie, that may hurt nature,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20181:86"/>but that gift, that is againÅ¿t nature. But the Å¿upernaturall gift, is neyther vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, neyther yet againÅ¿t nature: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot hurt, nor impaire nature: And my reaÅ¿on is this; ThoÅ¿e gifts that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core, and beautifie nature, they cannot hurt, nor impaire nature: But all Å¿uperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall gifts, beautifie, and decore nature; Therefore, they cannot take away, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, nor yet the naturall property.</p>
            <p>They leaue vs not Å¿o: but out of this doctrine of <hi>Paule,</hi> concerning the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the bodie, they drawe an obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preÅ¿Å¿e vs withall. <hi>Paul</hi> grants, that a glorified bodie, is a Å¿pirituall bodie: but a Å¿pirituall bodie, is an inuiÅ¿ible bodie; Therefore a glorified bodie, is inuiÅ¿ible: and by conÅ¿equence, the bodie of ChriÅ¿t is inuiÅ¿ible.</p>
            <p>Though the argument be not formall: yet to be Å¿hort, I denie their aÅ¿Å¿umption: for if there were no more but that word, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that word might be an argument, that the Å¿piritual bodie, is not inuiÅ¿ible. But yet to open the matter more cleerely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that place: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in a word as it were, in the 44. verÅ¿. of that Chap. Å¿heweth the change,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:87"/>that Å¿hall be in the qualities of the bodie, by the reÅ¿urrection: For he Å¿aith, that our naturall bodies, Å¿hall become Å¿pirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and then, in the next verÅ¿e immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following, hee expoundeth theÅ¿e two qualities: for in the 45. verÅ¿e, That is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a naturall bodie Å¿ayeth hee, which is maintained, and quickned by a liuing Å¿oule onely, Å¿uch as <hi>Adams</hi> was. And againe, that is Å¿aid to be a Å¿pirituall bodie, which together beÅ¿ides the Å¿oule, is quickned with a farre more excellent vertue, to wit, with the Å¿pirit of God, which deÅ¿cendeth from ChriÅ¿t the Å¿econd <hi>Adam,</hi> vnto vs: Then according vnto this ground, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿were with <hi>AuguÅ¿tine ad Constantium:</hi> As the naturall bodie is not a Å¿oule, but a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: Euen Å¿o, the Å¿pirituall bodie, is not Å¿aid to bee a Å¿oule, but a bodie. And by conÅ¿equent, it is not inuiÅ¿ible:: For the further explaining of this head, I will giue them onely one knot to looÅ¿e, and Å¿o ende this point. Then I reaÅ¿on: Yf therefore ChriÅ¿ts bodie, is naturally, and really in the Lords Supper, becauÅ¿e that it is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: It followeth conÅ¿equently, That when it was not glorified, it could not bee really preÅ¿ent. But it was not glorified
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20181:87"/>when this Å¿upper was firÅ¿t inÅ¿tituted: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not really preÅ¿ent in the bread, at ChriÅ¿ts firÅ¿t Supper. Yf his bodie was not really preÅ¿ent, in the bread, at the firÅ¿t Å¿upper, it cannot be naturally preÅ¿ent now. For whatÅ¿oeuer they vÅ¿e now in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿tration of their Supper, or of their MaÅ¿Å¿e, (call it as you will) according to their owne confesÅ¿ion, they vÅ¿e it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinance, forme, and maner, that ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us himÅ¿elfe vÅ¿ed, in his firÅ¿t Supper: For they Å¿ay plainely, in their diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation at <hi>PoysÅ¿ie,</hi> and in all the reÅ¿t of their works, That Chr. IeÅ¿us, firÅ¿t, of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erued that forme, which they vÅ¿e in their MaÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; left it to his ApoÅ¿tles, and to their Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ours, that they Å¿hould doe the like. And Å¿o by their owne words, they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled themÅ¿elues, and crucified their MaÅ¿Å¿e: what can they anÅ¿were to this? They will not Å¿tand dumbe, I am Å¿ure: for maintenance of their religion, they muÅ¿t Å¿ay Å¿ome thing. Thus they Å¿ay, That though the body of ChriÅ¿t, which was locally preÅ¿ent with the reÅ¿t of his diÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was not glorified, yet the body which hee exhibited in the bread, was glorified. They might as well haue held their peace,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:88"/>and Å¿ay nothing. For marke the words of the text, as they are written, Luke 22.19. where it is Å¿aid, <hi>And he tooke the bread, and when hee had giuen thankes, hee brake it, and gaue to them Å¿aying, This is my bodie, which is giuen for you:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.24. hath theÅ¿e words, <hi>Take, eate, this is my bodie, which is broken for you.</hi> This relatiue, which, is relatiue to the bodie, which was exhibited in the bread: for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne confesÅ¿ion, thoÅ¿e words are pronounced vpon the bread, &amp; directed vnto it: But that Å¿ame bodie was giuen, and broken for vs, that is to Å¿ay, crucified, and broken with anguiÅ¿h and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. Then I reaÅ¿on after this Å¿ort: <hi>To be crucified and broken with anguiÅ¿h and dolors, canne no waies agree and conuene, with a glorified bodie: But the bodie that ChriÅ¿t exhibited in the bread, is Å¿aid of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliÅ¿ts, to be crucified, and broken for vs: Ergo, that bodie was not glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now laÅ¿t of all, they are not yet content, but Å¿ay, ChriÅ¿t can make the bread his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; And therefore, his bodie is really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent. That ChriÅ¿t can make the bread his bodie, wee grant: for ChriÅ¿t being God, canne doe whatÅ¿oeuer hee will: onely let them Å¿hewe, That ChriÅ¿t will make of reall
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20181:88"/>bread, his reall fleÅ¿h, and then this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ie will ende. ChriÅ¿t indeede, makes the bread his bodie, not really, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally: For ChriÅ¿t hath not a bodie, made of bread; his bodie was made once of the pure Å¿ubÅ¿tance of his bleÅ¿Å¿ed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Another bodie then this, or oftner made then once, hath hee none: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all doctrine that teacheth ChriÅ¿ts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be made of bread, is impious, &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. The PapiÅ¿ts doctrine of reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence, teacheth, That ChriÅ¿ts bodie in the Sacrament, is made of bread, by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bread, into his bodie; through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ecration: wherefore we may boldly, and and truly conclude; That their doctrine, of reall preÅ¿ence, is both wicked, &amp; heretical. Now to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>clude this head: I beÅ¿eech them, Å¿eeing that reaÅ¿on fails the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, That they fight not againÅ¿t God, for maintenance of a lie, how old Å¿oeuer it bee (for the diuel is olde enough, &amp; yet he could neuer change his nature) But let them rather glorifie God, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fesÅ¿ing theÅ¿e Å¿peeches to be Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>etal.</p>
            <p>Then what is the reaÅ¿on, &amp; ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the PapiÅ¿ts pull downe the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the body of ChriÅ¿t and the blood of ChriÅ¿t, and make the verie Å¿ubÅ¿tance,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:89"/>to be corporallie,
<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on that moues the PapiÅ¿ts to thinke that Chr. bodie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preÅ¿ent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be really, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and Å¿ubÅ¿tanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent.</note> reallie, and Å¿ubÅ¿tantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Sacrament. The reaÅ¿on is this, BecauÅ¿e they cannot Å¿ee, by their naturall iudgement, nor can vnderÅ¿tand, by their natural wit, the truth of this, to wit, how ChriÅ¿ts fleÅ¿h, and blood, can bee preÅ¿ent in the Sacrament, except hee bee preÅ¿ent to their corporall hand, to their corporall mouth, and Å¿tomacke. If they had the light to informe them, That ChriÅ¿t might bee preÅ¿ent, in the Sacrament, and not to the hand, to the mouth, or Å¿tomack, they would neuer thinke of Å¿uch a monÅ¿trous preÅ¿ence, as they imagine to be there.

Wee anÅ¿were in a word; They are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, but not in the bread and wine, nor in the accidents, nor Å¿ubÅ¿tance of bread, and wine. And wee make ChriÅ¿t to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent in this Sacrament, becauÅ¿e hee is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent to my Å¿oule, to my Å¿pirit, and fayth. AlÅ¿o, we make him preÅ¿ent in the Lords Supper, becauÅ¿e I haue him in his promiÅ¿e, <hi>This is my bodie;</hi> which promiÅ¿e, is preÅ¿ent to my fayth: and the nature of fayth is, to make things, that are abÅ¿ent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues, yet preÅ¿ent: And therefore, Å¿eeing he is both preÅ¿ent, by fayth in his promiÅ¿e, &amp; preÅ¿ent by the vertue of his holy Å¿pirit, who can Å¿ay, but that hee is preÅ¿ent in this Sacrament?</p>
            <p>But yet the word would be explained,
<note place="margin">How a thing is Å¿aid to be preÅ¿ent and abÅ¿ent.</note> what we mean by the word, preÅ¿ent, how a thing is Å¿aid to be preÅ¿ent, &amp; abÅ¿ent. And knowing this, yee Å¿hall finde all the matter eaÅ¿ie. I Å¿ay, things are Å¿aid to be preÅ¿ent, as they are perceiued, by anie outward, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Å¿enÅ¿e, &amp; as they are perceiued, by any
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20181:90"/>of the Å¿enÅ¿es, Å¿o are they preÅ¿ent, &amp; the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be perceiued the further preÅ¿ent: and by what Å¿enÅ¿e any thing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, to that Å¿enÅ¿e, it is preÅ¿ent: As if it bee outwardly perceiued, by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Å¿enÅ¿e, that thing is outwardly preÅ¿ent. As for example, if it be perceiued by the outward Å¿ight of the eye, by the outward hearing of the eare, by the outward feeling of the hands or taÅ¿te of the mouth, it is outwardly preÅ¿ent. Or if any thing be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the inward eye, by the inward taÅ¿te, &amp; feeling of the Å¿oule, this thing can not be outwardly preÅ¿ent, but it muÅ¿t bee Å¿piritually, &amp; inwardly preÅ¿ent to the Å¿oul: So I Å¿ay, euery thing is preÅ¿ent, as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. So that if you perceiue not a thing outwardly, it is outwardly abÅ¿ent: and if ye perceiue not a thing inwardly, it is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abÅ¿ent. It is not diÅ¿tance of place, that makes a thing abÅ¿ent, nor propinquitie of place that makes a thing preÅ¿ent: But it is onely the perceiuing of any thing, by any of thy Å¿enÅ¿es, that makes a thing preÅ¿ent; &amp; the not perceiuing, that makes a thing abÅ¿ent: I Å¿ay, though the thing it Å¿elf were neuer Å¿o far diÅ¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, if thou perceiue it by thine outward Å¿enÅ¿e, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent vnto thee. As for example, my body,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:91"/>and the Å¿unne are as farre diÅ¿tant in place, as the heauen is, from the earth; and yet this diÅ¿tance Å¿tayeth not the Å¿unnes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence from mee: why? BecauÅ¿e I perceiue the Å¿unne by mine eie, and other Å¿enÅ¿es; I feele it, and perceiue it by the heate, by the light, and by his brightneÅ¿Å¿e: So if a thing were neuer Å¿o farre diÅ¿tant, if wee haue Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es to perceiue the Å¿ame, it is preÅ¿ent to vs. Then the diÅ¿tance of place, makes not a thing abÅ¿ent from thee, if thou haÅ¿t Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es to perceiueit: likewiÅ¿e the neereneÅ¿Å¿e of place makes not a thing preÅ¿ent, be it neuer Å¿o neere, if thou haÅ¿t not Å¿enÅ¿es to perceiue it: As for example, if the Å¿unne Å¿hine vpon thine eyes, if thou bee blinde, it is not preÅ¿ent to thee, becauÅ¿e thou canÅ¿t not perceiue it. A Å¿weete tune will neuer be preÅ¿ent to a deafe eare, though it be Å¿ung in the eare of that man, becauÅ¿e hee hath not a Å¿enÅ¿e to perceiue it: And a well told tale, will neuer bee preÅ¿ent to a foole, becauÅ¿e hee cannot vnderÅ¿tand it, nor hath no iudgement to perceiue it: So it is not the neereneÅ¿Å¿e, nor diÅ¿tance of place, that maketh any thing preÅ¿ent, or abÅ¿ent, but only the perceiuing, or not perceiuing of it.</p>

For this action of the Sacrament, and of the Lords Supper, is partly corporall, and partly Å¿pirituall: I call this action, partly corporall, not in reÅ¿pect onely, that the obiects, that is, That bread, and that wine, are corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but alÅ¿o in reÅ¿pect, my mouth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto theÅ¿e things are offered, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument whereby, and the manner how, theÅ¿e things are receiued, are all corporal, and naturall: I call the Å¿ame action againe, partly Å¿pirituall, not onely in reÅ¿pect of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, who is the heauenly, and Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing of the Sacrament, but alÅ¿o in reÅ¿pect of my Å¿oule, whereunto, Chr. is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and giuen, in reÅ¿pect the inÅ¿trument whereby, and the manner how, hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, are all Å¿pirituall: for I get not ChriÅ¿t corporally, but Å¿piritually: So in theÅ¿e reÅ¿pect, I call this action, partly corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and partly Å¿pirituall.</p>
            <p>Now, confounde not theÅ¿e two Å¿orts of
<pb facs="tcp:20181:92"/>actions, The corporall, and naturall Å¿ignes, with the Å¿pirituall thing, Å¿ignified thereby: againe, confound not the mouth of the bodie, with the mouth of the Å¿oule. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, confound not the outwarde manner of receuing, by the hand of the bodie, with the Å¿pirituall manner of receiuing, by the hand of the Å¿oule: And Å¿o it Å¿hall bee exceeding cleere to Å¿ee, that each thing Å¿hall bee preÅ¿ent, to the owne inÅ¿trument; that is, The bodie of ChriÅ¿t, which is the Å¿pirituall thing Å¿ignified, Å¿hall be preÅ¿ent to the Å¿pirituall mouth, and hand: and the bread, and wine, which are the corporall Å¿ignes, are preÅ¿ent to the corporall mouth and hand. Then how is any obiect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent? A corporall obiect, is corporally preÅ¿ent: and an inward obiect, is inwardly preÅ¿ent. Of what nature is the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? It is of an heauenly nature. Then aske you, how is he preÅ¿ent; He is Å¿piritually, and heauenly preÅ¿ent to the Å¿oule, and the mouth of the Å¿oule, which is faith, For it were a prepoÅ¿terous thing, to make the thing Å¿ignified preÅ¿ent to thy belly, or to the mouth or eye of thy body; for if that were Å¿o, it Å¿hould not be Å¿piritually preÅ¿ent: becauÅ¿e euery thing is preÅ¿ent as it agreeth in it owne nature. Is it a bodily thing? it is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20181:92"/>bodily preÅ¿ent: &amp; if it be a heauenly thing, it is Å¿piritually preÅ¿ent: So I thinke no man can doubt, how the bodie of ChriÅ¿t is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent: hee is not carnally preÅ¿ent, but Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preÅ¿ent to my Å¿oule, and to faith, in my Å¿oule: Thus far concerning the manner of his preÅ¿ence.</p>
            <p>Now the laÅ¿t part of our difference is this:
<note place="margin">The laÅ¿t point in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ie be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twixt vs, and the PapiÅ¿ts.</note> wee haue to conÅ¿ider to whom the words ought to be directed, &amp; pronounced: For we &amp; the PapiÅ¿ts differ in this laÅ¿t point; we Å¿ay, that the words ought to be directed, &amp; pronounced vnto the people, to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full communicants. They on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿ay, that the words ought not to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, nor pronounced to the people, but to the elements, &amp; not to be cleerly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but whiÅ¿pered on the elements; So that if they be Å¿poken to the people, or Å¿poken openly, their charme auailes not. Now, I Å¿ay, that as this holy action, is peruerted by them in all the reÅ¿t, Å¿o they peruert it in this point alÅ¿o, in Å¿peaking that, to the dumbe elements, which they Å¿hould Å¿peak to the people of God: For, I Å¿hall proue it cleerely, by three arguments taken out of the Scriptures, that the words ought not to be Å¿poken, to the bread, but to the people of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:93"/>
            <p>And firÅ¿t I Å¿ay, The promiÅ¿es of mercie and grace, ought to be directed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to them, in whom the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms them, &amp; makes them effectual: But Å¿o it is, That the promiÅ¿es of mercie and grace, are performed, and made effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, not in bread, and wine, but in fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men &amp; women: Therefore theÅ¿e pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es Å¿hould be directed, to faythfull men &amp; women. Now here is the promiÅ¿e of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; grace: <hi>This is my bodie which is broken for you:</hi> and this promiÅ¿e is made to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but to the faithfull, and Å¿o to them onely, it ought to bee directed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee haue to conÅ¿ider, That this Sacrament, Å¿eales vp a couenant of grace, and mercie. Now, with whom will God make his couenant of mercy, and grace? will hee make a couenant with a peece of bread, or any dumbe element: There is no man will enter into couenant with his Å¿eruant; much leÅ¿Å¿e, will enter into coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a dumbe element: So in reÅ¿pect this Sacrament Å¿eales vp a couenant, this couenant, of necesÅ¿itie, muÅ¿t bee made with a faithfull Å¿oule, and in no wiÅ¿e with the dumbe element: and therefore, theÅ¿e wordes cannot bee directed to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20181:93"/>elements. Thirdly, looke to the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Sacrament vvas appointed. Is it not to lead vs to ChriÅ¿t? Is it not to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h my faith in ChriÅ¿t? Is it not to nouriÅ¿h me in a conÅ¿tant perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, of the Lords mercy in ChriÅ¿t? Was this Sacrament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make the elements, Gods? No: for if ye marke Gods purpoÅ¿e in this inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, yee Å¿hall finde, that ChriÅ¿t hath not ordained this inÅ¿titution, to nobilitate the Elements, to fauour and reÅ¿pect the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were Bread, and Wine, ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿terday, to be Gods to day. Wee on the contrary, Å¿ay plainely, that the inÅ¿titution of ChriÅ¿t, reÅ¿pecteth not the elements, to alter their nature. Indeed, it is appointed to alter vs, to change vs, and to make vs more and more Å¿pirituall, and to Å¿anctifie the elements to our vÅ¿e. But the Å¿peciall end, is this, To make vs holie, and more &amp; more to growe vp, in a Å¿ure faith in ChriÅ¿t, and not to alter the Elements, nor to make them gods. And therefore, by all theÅ¿e three Arguments, it is euident, that the words ought not to be directed to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to the people, and faithfull Communicants.</p>
            <p>Now, to come to an end: There is one
<pb facs="tcp:20181:94"/>thing,
<note place="margin">ConcluÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</note> without the which wee cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, let vs diÅ¿courÅ¿e neuer Å¿o long vpon the right vnderÅ¿tanding of the Sacrament. Ye Å¿ee now, how all that is Å¿poken concerning the Sacrament, is grounded, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon faith. Let a man haue faith, be it neuer Å¿o little, hee Å¿hall get Å¿ome hold of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿ome inÅ¿ight, in the vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Sacrament: but wanting faith, though a man endeuour himÅ¿elfe to make the Sacraments neuer Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible, it is not poÅ¿sible that hee can gette any hold of ChriÅ¿t, or any inÅ¿ight of him. For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, we cannot be ChriÅ¿tians: we can neither get a Å¿ight of God, nor feele God in ChriÅ¿t, without faith.</p>
            <p>Faith is the onely thing, that tranÅ¿lates our Å¿oules, out of that death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vvherein vvee vvere conceiued and borne, and planteth life in vs. So, the vvhole Å¿tudie, and endeuour of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian, Å¿hould tend to this; To craue, that the Lord in his mercie, vvould illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his minde vvith the eye of faith, and that hee would kindle in his heart, a loue of faith, and vvorke in his hart, a thirÅ¿t, and deÅ¿ire of the obiect of faith, &amp; more and more, to thirÅ¿t, and hunger, for the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20181:94"/>foode of faith, that nouriÅ¿hes vs to life eternall.</p>
            <p>Without this faith, (hovv-Å¿oeuer the naturall man, vnderÅ¿tanding naturally, would flatter himÅ¿elfe) Å¿urely, there is no bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e; but all his life is more then terrible miÅ¿ery. For, what-Å¿oeuer it be that flatters, and pleaÅ¿eth thee now, be it a thought, or motion of the minde, or an action of the body, that pleaÅ¿eth thee now, without faith; the Å¿ame very motion, cogitation, or action, Å¿hall torment thee heereafter.</p>
            <p>So, vvithout faith, it is not poÅ¿sible to pleaÅ¿e GOD; and vvhatÅ¿oeuer pleaÅ¿eth not GOD, is done to torment thee: Therefore craue mercie, for whatÅ¿oeuer motion, cogitation, or action, vvherein thou haÅ¿t offended GOD; or, for the Å¿ame, God Å¿hall offend, and torment thee. And to eÅ¿chevv the offence of God, there is no meanes, but by true faith; therefore the Å¿tudie of a ChriÅ¿tian Å¿hould be, to grow in faith.</p>
            <p>Now, by hearing of the vvord, thou getteÅ¿t faith; and by receiuing this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou obtaineÅ¿t the increaÅ¿e of faith; and hauing faith, the receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb facs="tcp:20181:95"/>Å¿hall be fruitfull: but, vvithout faith, thou eateÅ¿t thineowne condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then the whole Å¿tudy of a ChriÅ¿tian is, to get faith; and this faith cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with idleneÅ¿Å¿e, but by earneÅ¿t pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: therefore, let euery one of vs fall downe, and craue earneÅ¿tly this faith, and the increaÅ¿e of it, whereby we may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiuers of this bleÅ¿Å¿ed Sacrament; and that for the righteous merits of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us. To whom, with the Father, and the holy Spirit, be all honour, praiÅ¿e, and glory, both now, and euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THough the doctrine of our triall, and due examination (well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us) ought to goe before the doctrine, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacrament: yet notwithÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Å¿eeing that preparation is alwaies, at all times, as well neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the hearing of the Å¿imple word, as for the receiuing of the viÅ¿ible Sacrament; (for no man can heare the word of God fruitfully, except in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure he prepare his Å¿oule, and prepare the eares of his hart, how to hear) therefore the doctrine of preparation, and due examination, muÅ¿t come in it ovvne
<pb facs="tcp:20181:96"/>place, and be very neceÅ¿Å¿ary for cuery one of you. The ApoÅ¿tle, in the words vvhich we haue read, deliuereth his counÅ¿aile, and giueth his aduiÅ¿e; and not onely giues his aduiÅ¿e, but giues his admonition, and commaund, That we Å¿hould not come to the Table of the Lord, That we Å¿hould not come to the hearing of the word, raÅ¿hly: but that euery one of vs, Å¿hould come to this holy worke, with reuerence; that wee Å¿hould prepare, and Å¿anctifie our Å¿elues in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure. And Å¿eeing we go vnto the King of heauens Table, it becomes vs to put on our beÅ¿t array. In a word, hee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the whole doctrine, and matter of this preparation, when he Å¿aith; <hi>Let euery man, and let euery woman, try and examine themÅ¿elues.</hi> As if he would Å¿ay, <hi>Let euery one of you, try and examine your Å¿oules.</hi> That is, try the eÅ¿tate of your owne harts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of your owne conÅ¿ciences. Marke and behold, in vvhat eÅ¿tate you heart is with GOD, and in what eÅ¿tate your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience is with your neighbour.</p>
            <p>He bids not your neighbour to try you, hee bids not your companion to try your hart; but he biddes your Å¿elfe, in perÅ¿on, to try your owne conÅ¿cience; hee biddes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20181:96"/>your Å¿elfe, try your owne hart; becauÅ¿e none can be certaine of the eÅ¿tate of your hart, or of the condition of your conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but your Å¿elfe.</p>
            <p>Now, he excludes not others from the tryall of you neither (for it is lawfull for the PaÅ¿tor to try you) but others cannot try you Å¿o narrowly, as ye your Å¿elues may; for no man can know Å¿o much of mee, as I know of my Å¿elfe. No man can be certaine of the eÅ¿tate of your hart, and condition of your conÅ¿cience; &amp; yet you your Å¿elues may be certaine of it. As for others, men may iudge of your hart, and conÅ¿cience, according to your works, and effects; and except your works &amp; effects bee very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and altogether vitious, we are bound in conÅ¿cience, to iudge charitably of your harts and conÅ¿ciences. Therefore, there is none Å¿o meet to try the Å¿pirit of a man, to try the hart, or conÅ¿cience of a man, as is the man himÅ¿elfe.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">The heads to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Sermons.</note> that this tryall may be the better made, ye haue firÅ¿t to vnderÅ¿tand what it is that ye Å¿hould try: What ye call a conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the ApoÅ¿t. commands you to try. Next, ye are to conÅ¿ider, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons &amp; cauÅ¿es ye Å¿hold try your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ciences.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:97"/>
            <p>Thirdly, and laÅ¿t of all; ye are to knowe in what chiefe points yee Å¿hould try, and examine your conÅ¿ciences. Then, that wee Å¿peake not vnto you of things vnknowen, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for euery one of you (Å¿eeing there is none of you that lacketh a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience) to vnderÅ¿tand what a conÅ¿cience is: and as neerely as GOD Å¿hall giue mee grace, I will bring you to the vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and knowledge of a conÅ¿cience.</p>
            <p>I call a conÅ¿cience,
<note place="margin">Definition of conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with the expoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paits therof.</note> a certaine feeling in the hart, reÅ¿embling the iudgement of the liuing GOD, following vpon a deed done by vs, flowing from a knowledge in the minde, accompanied with a certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hart, to wit, feare, or ioy, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or reioycing. Now, we will examine the parts of this definition. I call it firÅ¿t of all, a certaine feeling in the hart; for, the Lord hath left Å¿uch a Å¿tampe in the hart of euery man, that he doth not that thing Å¿o Å¿ecretly, nor Å¿o quietly, but hee makes his owne hart to Å¿mite him, and to Å¿trike him: hee makes him to feele in his owne hart, whether he hath done well, or ill.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath placed this feeling in the hart; why? BecauÅ¿e the eyes of God, looke not Å¿o much vpon the outward counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20181:97"/>and exterior behauiour, as vpon the inward hart. For he Å¿aith to <hi>Samuel,</hi> in the firÅ¿t booke, 16.7. <hi>The Lord beholds the hart.</hi> So, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. hee Å¿aith to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, The Lord Å¿earcheth all harts, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tands all imaginations, and thoughts.</hi> AlÅ¿o <hi>Ieremy</hi> 11.20. <hi>The Lord tries the reins and the hart.</hi> And the ApoÅ¿tle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. Å¿aith, <hi>The Lord Å¿hall lighten things that are hid in darknes, and make the counÅ¿els of the hart manifeÅ¿t.</hi> So, in reÅ¿pect that the Lord will chiefely haue to doe with the heart, therefore in the hart hee placeth this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is the chiefe part of conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>I Å¿ay next, that this feeling reÅ¿embleth the iudgement of God: for, this feeling was left, and placed in our Å¿oules for this end and purpoÅ¿e, that we might haue a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meÅ¿ticall, and familiar iudgement within our Å¿elues, to reÅ¿emble, and deÅ¿cribe, the Å¿ecret, and inuiÅ¿ible iudgement of the high God; A particular iudgement, to goe before that generall iudgement, in that generall and great day, where euery man Å¿hal be iuÅ¿tified, or condemned, according to the particular iudgement, that is within his owne conÅ¿cience. In the meane time,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:98"/>this conÅ¿cience is left in vs, to arreÅ¿t vs in this life; thereby, as it were, to eaÅ¿e the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, at that laÅ¿t Iudgement. For the bookes of our own conÅ¿ciences, in that laÅ¿t day Å¿hal be opened; &amp; euery man Å¿hal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, according to the report of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that is within his ovvne conÅ¿cience: therefore I Å¿ay, that our conÅ¿cience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿embles the iudgement of GOD.</p>
            <p>The third thing that I Å¿ay, is this; It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vpon a deed done by vs: our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, nor our hart Å¿trikes vs not, before the deede be done; our hart Å¿trikes vs not, before the euill deed be committed: no, it goes not before the deed; but the Å¿troke of the conÅ¿cience, and feeling of the hart, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes immediatly vpon the deed, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that the deed is no Å¿ooner done by thee, but thy conÅ¿cience applyes it to thy Å¿elf, and giues out the Å¿entence againÅ¿t thy Å¿elfe: therefore, I Å¿ay, It is a feeling, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vpon a deede done by vs.</p>
            <p>And next I Å¿ay, flowing from a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the minde; for except the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience haue information, and except the heart knovve, that the deede vvhich is done, is euill; the hart, nor the conÅ¿cience can neuer count it to be euill: therefore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20181:98"/>knowledge muÅ¿t goe before the Å¿troke of the conÅ¿cience: thy hart can neuer feele that to be euill, which thy minde knoweth not to be euill.</p>
            <p>So, knowledge muÅ¿t euer goe before feeling, and according to the meaÅ¿ure of thy knowledge, according to the nature, and qualitie of thy knowledge, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿hall the teÅ¿timonie and Å¿troke of thy conÅ¿cience be. For a light knowledge, a doubting, and vncertaine knowledge, makes a light, and Å¿mall Å¿troke: as on the other part, a holy and Å¿olid knowledge, drawne out of the word of God, maketh a heauy Å¿troke of the conÅ¿cience. So the conÅ¿cience muÅ¿t anÅ¿were to the knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If we haue no other knowledge, but the knowledge which wee haue by nature, and by the light &amp; Å¿parks which are left in nature, our conÅ¿cience will anÅ¿wer no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to that knowledge: but if beÅ¿ide the light of nature, we haue a knowledge of God in his word, &amp; a knowledge of God by his holy Å¿pirit, working in our harts; our coÅ¿ciences wil then go further, &amp; excuÅ¿e, or accuÅ¿e vs, according vnto the light that is in the word. So that the conÅ¿cience is not acquired, or obtained, at what time we are
<pb facs="tcp:20181:99"/>enlightened, by the working of the holie Spirit, and hearing of the word of GOD: but, our conÅ¿cience is borne with vs, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to vs, and is left in the Å¿oule of euery man &amp; woman: &amp; as there are Å¿ome Å¿parks of light left in nature, Å¿o there is a conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence left in it; and if there were no more, that Å¿ame light that is left in thy nature, Å¿hall be enough to condemne thee. So, the conÅ¿cience is not gotten, or begun at the hearing of the word, or at that time, when we begin to reforme our Å¿elues, by the aÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, and renuing of the holy Spirit: but euery man by nature hath a conÅ¿cience, &amp; the Lord hath left it in our nature; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that this conÅ¿cience be reformed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God, that Å¿ame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conÅ¿cience Å¿hall be enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee eternally: therefore, I Å¿ay, flowing from a knowledge of the minde. LaÅ¿t of all, I Å¿ay, accompanied with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine motion of the hart: and wee expreÅ¿Å¿e this motion, in feare, or ioy, trembling, or reioycing. In very great feare, if the deede be exceeding heynous, and the Å¿troke of the conÅ¿cience be very heauy; then the conÅ¿cience neuer taketh reÅ¿t, for guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e will euer dread. But if the deede be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20181:99"/>honeÅ¿t, godly, and commendable, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a glad hart, and maketh the hart euen to burÅ¿t out into ioy. So, to bee Å¿hort in this matter (for I purpoÅ¿e not to make a common place of it) yee Å¿ee, that in euerie conÅ¿cience, there muÅ¿t be two things: FirÅ¿t, there muÅ¿t be a knowledge; &amp; next, there muÅ¿t be a feeling: whereby, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy knowledge, thou applyeÅ¿t vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thine owne hart, the deed done by thee. So that, as the word it Å¿elfe teÅ¿tifieth, it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth of two parts: of knowledge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereunto it is called Å¿cience; and of feeling, according whereunto, the <hi>Con</hi> is added, and it is called ConÅ¿cience. Then the word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿cience, Å¿ignifieth knowledge, with application.</p>
            <p>This conÅ¿cience,

So that, that action can not be, Å¿o Å¿ecretly, Å¿o quietly, nor Å¿o cloÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueied, but will thou, nill thou, thy conÅ¿cience Å¿hall beare a teÅ¿timonie of it; thy conÅ¿cience Å¿hall be a faithfull obÅ¿eruer of it; and one day, Å¿hall bee a faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder
<pb facs="tcp:20181:100"/>of that action. So, the Lord hath appointed thy conÅ¿cience to this office, that it attends; and waits vpon thee in all thy actions.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> LikewiÅ¿e, the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thy conÅ¿cience, and placed it in thy Å¿oule, to be an accuÅ¿er of thee; Å¿o that when thou dooÅ¿t any euill deed, thou haÅ¿t a domeÅ¿ticall accuÅ¿er within thine ovvne Å¿oule,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to finde fault with it.

This is terrible: hee hath left it within thee, to be a very torture, and tormenter to thy Å¿elfe; and Å¿o to put thine owne Å¿entence in execution vpon thy Å¿elfe. Is not this a matter more then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20181:100"/>that one, and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Å¿hall Å¿erue to Å¿o many vÅ¿es in a Å¿oule; as to be a continuall obÅ¿eruer, and marker of thy actions; an accuÅ¿er; tenne thouÅ¿and vvitneÅ¿Å¿es; a Iudge; a Sergeant, and Tormentor; to execute thine ovvne Å¿entence againÅ¿t thy Å¿elfe? Å¿o that the Lord needs not to Å¿eeke a Sergeant, out of thine owne Å¿oule to arreÅ¿t thee, for thou Å¿halt haue all theÅ¿e within thy Å¿elfe, to make a plaine declaration againÅ¿t thy Å¿elfe. Take heede to this: for there is neuer a word of this Å¿hall fall to the ground; but either yee Å¿hall finde it to your comfort, or to your euerlaÅ¿ting woe. And this Å¿ecret, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular iudgement, that euery one of you carries about you, abideth Å¿o Å¿ure, and Å¿o faÅ¿t within you, that do what ye can, if yee would imploy your whole trauaile to blot it out, thou Å¿halt neuer get it Å¿craped out of thy Å¿oule. If ye were as malicious, and were becom as wicked, as euer any incarnate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell vvas vpon the earth, yet Å¿hall yee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer get this conÅ¿cience altogether extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hed out of thy Å¿oule: but will thou, nill thou, there Å¿hall as much remaine of it, as Å¿hal make thee inexcuÅ¿able in the great day of the generall Iudgement.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:101"/>
            <p>I grant, thou maiÅ¿t blot out all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge out of thy minde, and make thy Å¿elfe become euen as a blinde man. I grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o, that thou maiÅ¿t harden thy hart, Å¿o that thou wilt blot out all feeling out of it, Å¿o that thy conÅ¿cience will not accuÅ¿e thee, nor finde fault with thee, but thou Å¿halt haue a delight in dooing euill, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a remorÅ¿e: but I deny, that any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of wickednes in the earth, Å¿hall bring thee to this poynt, that thou maiÅ¿t do euill without feare; but Å¿till, the more that thou dooÅ¿t euill, and the longer that thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueÅ¿t in euill dooing, thy feare Å¿hall bee the greater: yea, in deÅ¿pight of the diuell, &amp; in deÅ¿pight of all the malice of the hart of man, thy feare Å¿hall remaine. And though they would both conÅ¿pire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they Å¿hall not be able to baniÅ¿h that feare, but that gnawing of the conÅ¿cience, Å¿hal euer remaine, to teÅ¿tifie, that there is a day of Iudgement. I grant alÅ¿o, that there Å¿hall be a viciÅ¿situde, and that feare Å¿hall not alwayes remaine, but Å¿hall be Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turned into Å¿ecuritie; neyther Å¿hall that Å¿ecurity alwayes abide, but Å¿hal be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe into feare: Å¿o that it is not poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible, to get this feare wholly extinct; but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20181:101"/>the greater that the Å¿ecuritie is, the greater Å¿hall thy feare be, when thou art wakened. Thirdly, I grant, that this feare Å¿hall bee blinde; for from that time, a man by euill dooing, hath baniÅ¿hed knowledge out of the minde, and feeling out of the heart, what can remaine there, but a blind feare? When men haue put out all light, and left nothing in their nature, but darkneÅ¿Å¿e, there can nothing remaine but a blinde feare. So I grant, that the feare is blinde: for neither knowe they from whence that feare commeth, vvhat progreÅ¿Å¿e it hath, whereunto it tendeth, where, nor when, it Å¿hall end: therefore, they that are this way miÅ¿ledde in their Å¿oules, or all men in the earth, they are moÅ¿t miÅ¿erable. For as long as thou maiÅ¿t keep in thy mind, a Å¿park of this knowledge, &amp; Å¿pirituall light, in the which thou maiÅ¿t Å¿ee the face of GOD in ChriÅ¿t, wherein thou maiÅ¿t Å¿ee a remedy, in the death and paÅ¿sion of ChriÅ¿t, &amp; wherein thou maiÅ¿t Å¿ee the bowels of mercy, offred in the bloud of ChriÅ¿t; if thou haue anie Å¿parke of this light (albeit it were neuer Å¿o little) to direct thee, and albeit this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were neuer Å¿o much wounded, yet there is mercy enough for thee in ChriÅ¿t:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:102"/>but if thou cloÅ¿e vp all the windowes of thy Å¿oule, and of thy hart, and make them to become palpable darknes, that thou ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweÅ¿t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> whence the terror comes, nor yet perceiueÅ¿t any remedy, that is the miÅ¿ery of all miÅ¿eries.</p>
            <p>We haue many things in generall to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning the eÅ¿tate of this our Country,
<note place="margin">Applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</note> wherein we liue. AlÅ¿o particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is not one of you, but haue great cauÅ¿e to take heed to your conÅ¿ciences now, while yee haue time; that yee baniÅ¿h not altogether this light, which is yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto you, and whereof Å¿ome Å¿parks yet remain. For I Å¿ee the moÅ¿t part of men, runne headlong to baniÅ¿h the Å¿parke of light that is in them, and will not reÅ¿t, Å¿o long as there is any Å¿parke of it left, vntill it be vtterly baniÅ¿hed. And when they haue done Å¿o, alas, what can follow, but a blinde and terrible feare in their conÅ¿ciences, vvhich they can neuer get extinguiÅ¿hed; a feare vvithout remedie; a growing feare, and not a decaying feare; a feare that will deuoure them wholly at the laÅ¿t. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, euery one of you be carefull of this light that is within you; take heede, that the foule affections of your harts, dravve
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20181:102"/>not your bodies after them; Å¿ee, at the leaÅ¿t, that thoÅ¿e affections baniÅ¿h not this light. And, Å¿o long as the Lord offers you this light, in time craue, that of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, hee vvould giue you the grace to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, to take a nevv courÅ¿e, and yet to amend your liues, vvhile time is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you.</p>
            <p>The body Å¿hall leaue the Å¿oule, and the Å¿oule Å¿hall leaue the bodie; but the conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Å¿hall neuer leaue the Å¿oule: but vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿o-euer the Å¿oule goeth, to the Å¿ame place Å¿hall the conÅ¿cience repaire; and looke in vvhat eÅ¿tate thy conÅ¿cience is, when thou departeÅ¿t out of this life, in the Å¿elfe Å¿ame eÅ¿tate Å¿hall it meet thee in the great Day. So that if thy conÅ¿cience was a tormentor to thee at the time of thy death, if thou gette it not then pacified, it Å¿hall be alÅ¿o a tormentor to thee, in that generall Iudgement. Therefore, this matter vvould bee vvell vveighed, and euerie one of you Å¿hould Å¿tudie to haue a good conÅ¿cience, that vvhen the Å¿oule is Å¿euered from the body, leauing your conÅ¿cience at reÅ¿t, and peace with God, it may be reÅ¿tored vnto you, &amp; meet you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, with as great peace and quietnes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:103"/>
            <p>Thus farre concerning conÅ¿cience, what it is. I beÅ¿eech the liuing Lord, Å¿o to Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your memories, that ye may keep theÅ¿e things; and that euery one of theÅ¿e things may be Å¿o imprinted in your harts, that ye may be mindful of them, all your liues.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd thing that we are to Å¿peake of, is this: We are to conÅ¿ider wherfore we Å¿hould try our conÅ¿ciences; for what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es we Å¿hould examine our own Å¿oules and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ciences. I wil declare the reaÅ¿ons brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It behooueth euery one of you to try your conÅ¿cience. Why? BecauÅ¿e the Lord will make his reÅ¿idence, in no other part of the Å¿oule, but in the conÅ¿cience: Hee hath appointed his dwelling to be in the hart of man, and in the will, and conÅ¿cience of man; and therefore it becomes you, to make his dwelling place cleane, &amp; to take heeed vnto your harts.</p>
            <p>Next; though the Lord of heauen made not his reÅ¿idence there: yet, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect the eye of GOD is an all-Å¿eeing eye, and able to pearce throgh the very thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of mans fleÅ¿h, how darke and groÅ¿Å¿e Å¿oeuer it be, and to enter into the very Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corners of thy conÅ¿cience; (for vnto the all-Å¿eeing eye of GOD, the moÅ¿t Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20181:103"/>corner of the conÅ¿cience, is as cleare and manifeÅ¿t, as any outward, or bodily thing in the earth, can be to the outward eye of the body): In reÅ¿pect therefore that this eye is Å¿o pearcing, and that hee caÅ¿ts his eye onely vpon our harts, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth vs to try our harts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hee is the Lord of the conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There is no Monarch on earth, that hath any Å¿oueraigntie or lordÅ¿hippe ouer the conÅ¿cience: onely the GOD of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, onely ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, is Lord of the conÅ¿cience, hee hath power onely to Å¿aue and loÅ¿e. Therefore, vvhen thou commeÅ¿t to this Sacrament of the Lords Table, thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t carefully to looke vnto thy conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to try and examine the Å¿tate of it.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿t of all, vvhich is a chiefe reaÅ¿on; It behooueth thee to prooue thy conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauÅ¿e the welfare and health of thy Å¿oule, dependeth vpon thy conÅ¿cience. If thy conÅ¿cience that is within thy Å¿oule, be well, if it be at peace and reÅ¿t, thy Å¿oule is vvell; if thy conÅ¿cience be in a good eÅ¿tate, thy Å¿oule muÅ¿t needs be in a good eÅ¿tate; if thy conÅ¿cience bee in good health, of neceÅ¿sity thy Å¿oule muÅ¿t be in
<pb facs="tcp:20181:104"/>good health; for the good health, &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿Å¿e of the Å¿oule, dependes vpon a good conÅ¿cience: therefore, it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth euery one of you, to try well your conÅ¿ciences.</p>
            <p>There vvas neuer any lavv made, or deuiÅ¿ed, that forbade vs to haue a care of our healths; it is lawfull for vs to Å¿eeke Å¿uch things as may procure, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue it: but the health of thy Å¿oule, Å¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the health of thy conÅ¿cience, and in preÅ¿eruing thereof: therefore, by all lawes, thou oughteÅ¿t to attend thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience. If thou keepe thy conÅ¿cience wel, thy Å¿oule is in health; and if thy Å¿oule be in health, let troubles come what will vpon thy bodie, thou wilt indure them all; but if thy Å¿oule be diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed with an euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, thou Å¿halt not be able to beare out the leaÅ¿t trouble that Å¿hall come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy bodie: vvhereas, if the conÅ¿cience were at reÅ¿t, and in good health, that trouble could not happen vnto thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but the Å¿trength of a good conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vvould beare it out. Then haue yee not reaÅ¿on, and more then reaÅ¿on, to take heed to your conÅ¿ciences, to try, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your conÅ¿ciences, in vvhat eÅ¿tate
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20181:104"/>and diÅ¿poÅ¿ition they Å¿tand?</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">Certaine leÅ¿Å¿ons to be learned, by which a man may preÅ¿erue health in his Å¿oule &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience.</note> becauÅ¿e it is a fruitleÅ¿Å¿e thing to tell you, that health is neceÅ¿Å¿arie, and not to Å¿hew the vvay how this health may be obtayned and preÅ¿erued; therfore to keep your conÅ¿ciences in quiet, &amp; good health, I will giue you theÅ¿e few leÅ¿Å¿ons. FirÅ¿t of all, bee Å¿ure, that yee retaine Å¿tedfaÅ¿t, a perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of the mercie of GOD, in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us; examine vvhen thou lyeÅ¿t downe, and examine when thou riÅ¿eÅ¿t vp, in what eÅ¿tate thou art with God; whether thou maiÅ¿t looke for mercy at his hands, or not.</p>
            <p>Art thou perÅ¿waded of mercy? AÅ¿Å¿ure thy Å¿elfe thy conÅ¿cience is in a good eÅ¿tate, thou haÅ¿t health in thy Å¿oule; for, by the keeping of faith, the conÅ¿cience is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erued, as Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. Keepe this perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, preÅ¿erue it vvhole and Å¿ound, hurt it not, bring not thy Å¿oule into doubting, Å¿tay not, nor hinder thy perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, if thou deÅ¿ire to keep health in thy Å¿oule: for, if thou doubt, or any way diminiÅ¿h thy perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, and aÅ¿Å¿urance, aÅ¿Å¿uredlie, thy aÅ¿Å¿urance cannot Å¿o Å¿oon be hindered, nor diminiÅ¿hed, but at that very inÅ¿tant, Å¿hall follow the diminiÅ¿hing of the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:105"/>health of thy Å¿oule; yea, it cannot be, but in that very article of time, Å¿hall follow the hurt of thy conÅ¿cience; for faith will not dwell, but in a whole conÅ¿cience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at what time thou dooÅ¿t any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t thy conÅ¿cience, at that very time, thou loÅ¿eÅ¿t a degree of thy perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of the mercy of God: and vntill Å¿uch time as thou fall downe at the feet of ChriÅ¿t, and obtaine mercie for that wicked deed, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaÅ¿e peace at his hands, and repaire thy perÅ¿vvaÅ¿ion, thou Å¿halt euer doubt of mercie, and vvant health in thy conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Then this is the firÅ¿t leÅ¿Å¿on, to keepe health in your Å¿oules, To be perÅ¿waded of mercie.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd leÅ¿Å¿on to keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, or to keepe health in thy Å¿oule, is this; Yee muÅ¿t flie, eÅ¿chew, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, vvhatÅ¿oeuer may trouble the health of your Å¿oule, whatÅ¿oeuer may trouble the quietneÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; peaceable eÅ¿tate of your conÅ¿cience: caÅ¿t it out, forbeare it, and eÅ¿chew it. This generall is good. But let vs Å¿ee vvhat it is that troubles the quiet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate of the conÅ¿cience. Onely Å¿inne; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an euill nature. Therefore vvee muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿sitie, to keepe health in our
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20181:105"/>Å¿oules, forbeare and eÅ¿chew Å¿inne; we muÅ¿t flie and auoyde Å¿in. It is not poÅ¿sible, that ye can both keepe a good conÅ¿cience, and Å¿erue the affections of your hart: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to keepe peace &amp; health in thy Å¿oule, thou muÅ¿t take leaue of thy luÅ¿ts; thou muÅ¿t renounce the luÅ¿ts, and affections of thy hart, and thou muÅ¿t not doe as thou waÅ¿t wont to doe: thou muÅ¿t not be giuen to the Å¿eruice of thine affections, and of thine appetite, to put them in execution, as thou haÅ¿t formerly done. But in-caÅ¿e thine affections, or luÅ¿t commaund thee to doe any thing, what is thy part? Thou muÅ¿t try, how far this may Å¿tand with the good will of God; and how far that affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which commaunds thee, may agree with the law of God. Is there Å¿uch a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, as that, that thing which thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection commaunds thee, may Å¿tand with Gods law, and holy will? Then no queÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is a Å¿anctified affection, thou maiÅ¿t put it in execution. But after this tryall, if thou finde thine affections to be exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, &amp; out of rule, carying thee from God, &amp; againÅ¿t his law, beware of it, reÅ¿iÅ¿t it, put it not in execution; for if thou fulfill the will of thine affections, what pleaÅ¿ure can it
<pb facs="tcp:20181:106"/>bring with it? It may well bring a flattering pleaÅ¿ure in the entrie, but it cloÅ¿eth euer with a bitter remorÅ¿e in the end. Then to eÅ¿chew this bitter remorÅ¿e, Å¿hould yee not all try your affections? Yee muÅ¿t examine and try them by the Å¿quare of Gods lavv; yee muÅ¿t Å¿ee how farre they agree with his law, and how fatre they diÅ¿Å¿ent from it; &amp; Å¿o farre as they are diÅ¿Å¿onant from that law, let euery man deny himÅ¿elfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his affections: and Å¿o, this triall beeing taken in this manner, by thy Å¿elfe, it Å¿anctifieth thine affections, maketh ChriÅ¿t to lodge in thy Å¿oule, maketh thy conÅ¿cience to be at reÅ¿t. And the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit this way, maketh both bodie, and Å¿oule, to bee in good health, and to reioyce. Then flie from Å¿inne. This is the Å¿econd leÅ¿Å¿on.</p>
            <p>The third leÅ¿Å¿on is this; Studie to doe well. WouldeÅ¿t thou keepe health in thy Å¿oule? Study to do better and better conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually: At the leaÅ¿t, haue a purpoÅ¿e in thy Å¿oule &amp; hart, to doe better daily; which is the laÅ¿t leÅ¿Å¿on. Seeing that when we Å¿tudie to do beÅ¿t, &amp; that the iuÅ¿t man, that is, the moÅ¿t holy man, falleth Å¿o often as 7. times a day, yea rather, 70. times Å¿eauen times,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20181:106"/>what is thy part in theÅ¿e Å¿lips, and Å¿nares? Though thou fal, as thou canÅ¿t not eÅ¿chew to fall, lie not Å¿till there; Å¿leepe not there where thou haÅ¿t faln: it is a Å¿hame to Å¿leepe there, therefore ariÅ¿e againe. And hovv Å¿houldeÅ¿t thou riÅ¿e? By lifting vp thy Å¿oule, and running to the Fountaine of grace and mercy; by repayring to ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, to obtaine mercy for thy Å¿oule; and to craue, that hee would Å¿end out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe, that meaÅ¿ure of peace, that may put thy conÅ¿cience at reÅ¿t, &amp; reÅ¿tore thy Å¿oule to health. So, lie not where thou falleÅ¿t, but incontinent ariÅ¿e, &amp; craue mercy; and in obtayning mercy, thou Å¿halt repaire thy fal, thou Å¿halt amend thy life by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tance, &amp; by repentance thou Å¿halt get peace, thou Å¿halt haue thy conÅ¿cience at reÅ¿t, and get health to thy Å¿oule. Now keep this rule, if thou deÅ¿ireÅ¿t to keepe thy Å¿oule in health: look that thou Å¿leep not in Å¿inne, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did: lie not Å¿till vvhen thou art faln, and Å¿o fall from one Å¿inne, to another; as from adultery, to murther, from murther, to the next, &amp;c. As commonly, if a man Å¿leepe in Å¿in, and riÅ¿e not in time, one Å¿in wil draw on another; for there is no Å¿in alone, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the greater, and more heynous that
<pb facs="tcp:20181:107"/>the Å¿inne is, it hath the greater, and worÅ¿e Å¿innes wayting on it. Therefore, when yee fall, delay not to ariÅ¿e, but repaire to the fountaine of mercie, and Å¿eeke grace in time: runne to prayer, run to the Church of God, whereÅ¿oeuer it be, whether in the fielde, or in the towne: runne to ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us, and craue mercy of him, that yee may haue peace in your conÅ¿ciences; and Å¿o by theÅ¿e meanes, euery one of you Å¿hall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue health in your Å¿oules. By theÅ¿e meanes, ye Å¿hall learne what difference is, betwixt this liuing word of mercy, and grace, which Å¿ounds in our religion; and that Å¿laying letter, that kills the Å¿oule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that heares it; I meane that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous doctrine, of that dumbe MaÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>I mention this vnto you, becauÅ¿e I Å¿ee, that many in theÅ¿e dayes are fallen to it, and the Lord is beginning to abÅ¿tract his grace, and mercy from this Country, for the contempt of this quickning vvord, which hath Å¿o cleerely Å¿ounded heere, &amp; which our country-men, for the greateÅ¿t part (running headlong to the diuell in a dumbe guiÅ¿e) trauaile vtterly to baniÅ¿h. Is not this a miÅ¿erable thing, that Å¿o fevv of you haue eyes to conÅ¿ider, and diÅ¿cerne,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20181:107"/>of the time of peace, mercy, and grace, which is Å¿o aboundantly offred? The Lord of his mercy, giue you eyes in time.</p>
            <p>Thus far concerning the reaÅ¿ons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery one of you Å¿hould try and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your owne conÅ¿ciences: and this triall ought not to be for a day, or for a yeere; but it ought to be euery day, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere of thy whole life. For that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience that Å¿hould reÅ¿t for euer with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, that conÅ¿cience, which muÅ¿t e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer behold the face of the Sonne of God, it cannot be ouer-well cleanÅ¿ed; wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke ouer-narrowly to it. The more curious we be in Å¿earching out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, we are the better occupied: I Å¿peak of our own conÅ¿ciences, I Å¿peak not of our neighbours.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I come to the points,
<note place="margin">In what points wee Å¿hould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our conÅ¿ciences.</note> wherein euery one of you Å¿hould try and examine your Å¿elues. Euery one of you ought to try &amp; examine your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ciences in two things: FirÅ¿t, whether thou be at peace with God, who is the Lord of heauen, or not. Next, examine thy conÅ¿cience, whether thou art in loue &amp; amity with thy neighbor, or not. WouldeÅ¿t thou know, whether thy conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be at vnity &amp; peace with God, or not?
<pb facs="tcp:20181:108"/>Thou Å¿halt know it this way; The God of heauen, can haue no Å¿ocietie nor compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with that Å¿oule, which is alwaies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, that is euery way defiled; no, hee cannot.</p>
            <p>Now, I Å¿peake not Å¿o preciÅ¿ely, that I make a Å¿oule to be fully Å¿anctified, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy in this life: no, in this life, there are wonderfull iniquities, groÅ¿Å¿e Å¿innes, &amp; great faults, where-with, euen the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are defiled: but this is my meaning; There is no Å¿oule can be at any peace with God, or wherewith the Lord can haue any Å¿ocietie, but in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure it muÅ¿t bee Å¿anctified, and made holy. For God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make reÅ¿idence in a Å¿oule, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies as a Å¿linking dunghill; and therfore of force, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure it muÅ¿t be Å¿anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: there muÅ¿t be Å¿o much made cleane in one corner, or other, of that Å¿oule, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord of heauen, by his holy Spirit, may make his reÅ¿idence.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs Å¿ee wherby the Å¿oule is Å¿anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 15.9. Å¿aith, That the Å¿oule of man is purified by faith; that the hart of man is purged by faith. So, faith openeth and purgeth the hart. By faith in Chr. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us, and in the merits of his bloud, we haue
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20181:108"/>peace with God: <hi>Beeing iuÅ¿tified by faith, we haue peace towards God, through our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Now then, this point commeth in, That yee are to proue your Å¿elues, whether ye be in the faith, or not; as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Proue your Å¿elues, vvhether ye are in the faith.</hi> Examine if your Å¿oules be Å¿eaÅ¿oned with this faith; for if ye haue not faith in ChriÅ¿t, ChriÅ¿t is not in you; and if ChriÅ¿t be not in you, yee are in an euill Å¿tate, ye are in the eÅ¿tate of the reprobate, and damned. So euery one ought to looke carefully, and Å¿ee if he haue a beliefe in the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, or not: whether hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue to obtaine mercy by his merits, and Å¿anctification by his bloud, or not. For if thou haue no meaÅ¿ure of this faith, thou haÅ¿t no meaÅ¿ure of peace with GOD, by reaÅ¿on our peace with God, is ingendered and groweth dailie more and more by true faith in ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Novv this faith, vvhere it is true, where it is liuely, and couples the heart vvith GOD, as I haue alreadie Å¿aid, it muÅ¿t breake foorth in voord and deede, it can by no meanes bee held in, but it vvill break forth. It muÅ¿t breake out in word, in
<pb facs="tcp:20181:109"/>glorifying the God of heauen, who hath forgiuen vs our Å¿innes; it muÅ¿t break forth in word, by giuing a notable confeÅ¿sion of thoÅ¿e Å¿innes wherein vvee haue offended him. It muÅ¿t breake out in deed, in doing good works, to teÅ¿tifie to the world, that thing which is within thy hart; to teÅ¿tifie to the world, that thou, who haÅ¿t this faith, art a new man; that by thy good example of life and conuerÅ¿ation, thou maiÅ¿t edify thy brethren, the Å¿imple ones of the Church of God; and that, by thy holie life, thou maiÅ¿t drawe Å¿inners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; that they Å¿eeing thy good light, may bee compelled to glorifie GOD in thee.</p>
            <p>Then, in the firÅ¿t poynt of triall, let vs looke to theÅ¿e three; to the hart, to the mouth, to the hand. Take heed that there be a harmonie betwixt theÅ¿e three; for, if the hart be inwardly coupled with God, there is no doubt, but the mouth vvill outvvardlie glorifie him; and if thy hart and mouth bee renevved, and bee one, of neceÅ¿sitie thou wilt expreÅ¿Å¿e it in thy conuerÅ¿ation. There muÅ¿t bee an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the heart and the hand, thy conuerÅ¿ation muÅ¿t bee changed with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20181:109"/>the heart, and be holy, honeÅ¿t, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the heart is: So that if thy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation be good, it is a Å¿ure token, that thou art at one with God: but if thy conuerÅ¿atio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> bee not good, Å¿peake what thou wilt, thy heart is but defiled; this true, and liuelie faith, hath no place in it. Then wouldeÅ¿t thou know, when thou art at one with God? When thy conuerÅ¿ation, thy heart, and thy mouth Å¿ay all one thing, then without queÅ¿tion, thou haÅ¿t the worke of fayth, wrought by the holy Å¿pirit in thy heart, which maketh thee to bee at peace with God. This is the firÅ¿t poynt, wherein yee Å¿hould trie your Å¿elues.</p>
            <p>The next point, is loue: yee muÅ¿t trie, whether ye be in loue, and charitie with your neighbours, or not: for, as thou art not coupled with God, but by the hand of faith; Å¿o thou art not coupled with thy neighbour, nor ioyned with any member of ChriÅ¿t in this world, but by the hand of loue, amitie, and charitie. Take away loue, thou art not a member of this bodie: for loue is the maiÅ¿ter Å¿innowe, and couples all theÅ¿e members of ChriÅ¿ts bodie together, and makes them to growe vp, in a Å¿piritual, and myÅ¿ticall vnitie: loue, is the onely
<pb facs="tcp:20181:110"/>marke, whereby the children of ChriÅ¿t, and members of ChriÅ¿ts bodie, are knowen from the reÅ¿t of the world: loue is that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyle that refreÅ¿heth our Å¿oules, &amp; makes vs like vnto God; and the more we growe in loue, the more God by his Å¿pirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs, for God is loue: So that except in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, loue towards thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, dwel in thy heart, thou canÅ¿t haue no Å¿ocietie with thy neighbour, and far leÅ¿Å¿e with God. If the manners of men were examined by this rule, wee Å¿hould finde a multitude of godleÅ¿Å¿e people in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, who haue their hearts raging with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, one againÅ¿t another: and where the diuell and the malicious Å¿pirite dwell, there is no place for the holy Å¿pirit. And although the Lord hath gone about by all meanes posÅ¿ible, early, and late, to inÅ¿truct them, and to infuÅ¿e into them this preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous loue, and amitie towards God, &amp; their neighbour, and Å¿o to alter their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Yet they will not Å¿uffer themÅ¿elues to be wakened, vntil the great vengeance, and malediction of God fal vpon them: This loue, this honeÅ¿t, and godly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation floweth alwaies from the roote of fayth. So that if thy heart haue faith in any meaÅ¿ure, be it neuer Å¿o little, in that Å¿ame
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20181:110"/>meaÅ¿ure, thou muÅ¿t haue loue towards thy neighbour: &amp; this loue is neuer idle, but is vttering it Å¿elfe, in one effect or other: And in reÅ¿pect that faith is the ground whereupon all the reÅ¿t dependes, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect, that this fayth is Å¿uch a Iewell, as without the which it is not posÅ¿ible for any of you to pleaÅ¿e God, without which, all your deedes are abhomination before him, without the which you are in the greateÅ¿t miÅ¿erie (w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> miÅ¿erie is Å¿o much the more terrible, in that you are ignorant of it) Is it not good reaÅ¿on, that ye know, and vnderÅ¿tand, how this faith is firÅ¿t wroght &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> nouriÅ¿ht, in your Å¿ouls, by the holy Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? that Å¿eeing how it is created, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it is brought about, ye may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>Å¿ciences, &amp; Å¿ee whether ye be in the faith or not. My purpoÅ¿e was to haue inÅ¿iÅ¿ted longer on this matter, then this time will Å¿uffer. Now therefore, as time wil permit, and GOD Å¿hall giue grace, I will let you vnderÅ¿tand, how the H. Å¿pirit imployes his trauaile in the heart &amp; minde of man, &amp; what paines the holy GhoÅ¿t ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in creating, and forming this Iewell of fayth in your Å¿oules: Yet, before I enter this work, to let you Å¿ee the trauailes
<pb facs="tcp:20181:111"/>of the Å¿pirit of God, in working of this fayth in your hearts: It is neceÅ¿Å¿arie, and more then neceÅ¿Å¿arie, that yee vnderÅ¿tand, firÅ¿t your owne miÅ¿erie, and infirmitie: and that yee knowe, how the Lord was induced to recouer you, out of your old eÅ¿tate, and to recreate you, who were loÅ¿t, by the fall of your father <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then to conÅ¿ider of this matter more deepely, I offer to your remembrances this ground: That man vniuerÅ¿ally, and euery one particularly, being corrupted, being loÅ¿t, and that by our firÅ¿t fathers fall (for if there were no more, but that Å¿ame firÅ¿t faulte and Å¿inne of his, wee are all of vs iuÅ¿tly condemned, to a double death both of bodie, and Å¿oule for euer) Man, thus vniuerÅ¿ally, and particularly, being vtterly loÅ¿t, without any hope at all of recouery left in his Å¿oule, without any Å¿enÅ¿e of the recouery of that fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eÅ¿tate, or repairing of that Image which hee had loÅ¿t through Å¿inne, long before; hee beeing I Å¿ay loÅ¿t by this Å¿inne, and left in this deÅ¿perate eÅ¿tate in himÅ¿elf: what doth God? The euerliuing God, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiÅ¿e, whoÅ¿e waies are vnÅ¿earchable, hath found out a way, how that man, this way
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20181:111"/>loÅ¿t, yet hee may bee Å¿aued: heerein hee Å¿ought counÅ¿ell, from whom? Not from any creature, but hee counÅ¿elled with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe; The perÅ¿ons of the Trinitie tooke counÅ¿ell of them Å¿elues, one God was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to Å¿eeke counÅ¿ell from himÅ¿elfe, only moued in himÅ¿elfe: for hee had not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall principall without himÅ¿elfe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him. So, he Å¿eeking this counÅ¿aile at himÅ¿elfe, and being moued in himÅ¿elfe thereto: As <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.9. what doth hee? when all men Å¿hould haue died for euer, it pleaÅ¿ed him of his infinite mercie, to Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect out of all, and to elect a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, out of the loÅ¿t race of <hi>Adam,</hi> that Å¿hould haue periÅ¿hed for euer. In this his counÅ¿ell and decree, moued I Å¿ay of himÅ¿elfe, and Å¿eeking counÅ¿ell from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe only, he Å¿elects a certaine number, out of this rotten race, which certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hee will haue Å¿anctified, hee will haue iuÅ¿tified, hee will haue glorified: And therefore to bring to paÅ¿Å¿e the worke of their Å¿aluation: what doth hee? hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointes his owne naturall Å¿onne (for hee had but one naturall Å¿onne) hee appointes the Å¿econd perÅ¿on of the Trinitie, his owne naturall Å¿onne, God, in power, glory, and
<pb facs="tcp:20181:112"/>maieÅ¿tie, as high as himÅ¿elfe, equall with God the father in all things, hee appoints him to worke this worke, to bring to paÅ¿Å¿e this worke of our redemption, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Å¿aluation (This is but the myÅ¿terie of it, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure diÅ¿cloÅ¿ed). And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fulnes of time, (for hee diÅ¿pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth all things according to his wiÅ¿dome) at Å¿uch time as hee appointed, hee makes his Å¿onne to come downe, to Å¿eiÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe in the wombe of the Virgin, to take on our fleÅ¿h, to take on the likenes of Å¿inne; hee tooke not on Å¿in, but he tooke on the likenes of Å¿inne: what call I that likenes? our fleÅ¿h is the likeneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿inne: he tooke on our fleÅ¿h, and nature, the likenes of Å¿in, which was perfectly Å¿anctified, the verie moment of his conception, in the verie wombe of the Virgin: Hee tooke on this fleÅ¿h, that in this fleÅ¿h, and nature, Å¿in might be baniÅ¿hed, and caÅ¿t out of vs fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: And whereas we Å¿hould all of vs haue gone one way (for there was no exception of perÅ¿ons by nature) Chr. IeÅ¿. our Å¿auiour, hath elected vs: &amp; according as his father in his Å¿ecret election, before the beginning of the world, had elected vs; the Å¿ame Chr. IeÅ¿us in his owne time, calleth vs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20181:112"/>vs partakers, of that Å¿aluation, which he hath purchaÅ¿ed, &amp; he repaires not only that image which was loÅ¿t in our forefather <hi>Adam:</hi> he placeth vs, not in a terreÅ¿triall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiÅ¿e, where <hi>Adam</hi> was placed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (and what more could haue bin Å¿ought by vs?) but he giues vs a far more excellent image, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we loÅ¿t, he placeth vs in a more high, &amp; in a more celeÅ¿tial para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿e, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> we loÅ¿t: For Å¿o much the more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ly is the paridiÅ¿e w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he giues vs, as the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> is more excellent then the firÅ¿t, and as the Å¿on of God, &amp; God himÅ¿elfe, is farre aboue any creature, that euer was; man, or Angell. Therfore it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e, that by the benefit of the Å¿econd <hi>Adam,</hi> Chr. IeÅ¿us our Sauior, the Å¿on of God (whereas had we remained in that Image, wherin our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was firÅ¿t created, wee Å¿hould haue Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled our Å¿elues in the earth for euer, wee could not haue craued a beter paradiÅ¿e then an earthly paradiÅ¿e, for earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles) By benefit of the Å¿onne of God, I Å¿ay, it commeth to paÅ¿s, that we are pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp, out of the earth, to the heauen &amp; to a heauenly paradiÅ¿e. And what haue wee to doe with heauen? Are wee not made of the earth, to returne to the earth? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not an earthly paradiÅ¿e an earthly
<pb facs="tcp:20181:113"/>bodie? yet the Lord in his mercy, Å¿endeth downe his Å¿onne, to draw vs vp, out of the earth, to the heauen. This is Å¿o high a thing that it cannot bee eaÅ¿ily conÅ¿idered. For this drawing of vs, to a heauenly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiÅ¿e, is a thing, more then could haue beene thought on. That wee Å¿hould liue the life of Angels in heauen: how could the heart of man, thinke on this? yet it pleaÅ¿ed the liuing Lord, in the great riches, and bowels of his mercie, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatnes, of the power of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie towards vs (The ApoÅ¿tle in that EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>EpheÅ¿ians,</hi> cannot get words enow to expreÅ¿Å¿e this, he knowes not how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, nor how to end, when hee Å¿peakes of the riches of that mercie. And if yee looke well into that EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>EpheÅ¿ians,</hi> yee Å¿hall finde more high, and excellent Å¿tiles, giuen to the riches of that mercy, in that EpiÅ¿tle, then in any other part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) It pleaÅ¿ed him I Å¿ay, of his own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not to giue vs Å¿imply the Image which wee loÅ¿t, nor to leaue vs, in this earth: but it pleaÅ¿ed him, to giue vs a better I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and beÅ¿ide that, to place vs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, there to remaine with him for euer.</p>
            <p>Now, reÅ¿teth his mercie and grace
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20181:113"/>heere? No: But that this Å¿aluation, which hee hath alreadie purchaÅ¿ed, and brought about, by his Å¿onne, our Sauiour, ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, that it might be wholly accompliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hauing nothing wanting in it: As hee redeemed vs, in his owne perÅ¿on perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; So, he makes this Å¿ame redemption to come to our knowledge, and make vs Å¿ure of it in our conÅ¿ciences: and to this end, what doeth hee? As by his death, he purchaÅ¿ed our full redemption, Å¿o hee makes it knowen vnto vs, hee intimates it vnto vs; by our inward calling, letting vs both finde, and feele in our hearts, what hee did in his bodie for vs. For our Lord when hee makes his Å¿eruants, to proclaime this redemption, and to intimate it to our conÅ¿ciences, hee workes this Iewell of faith in our Å¿oules, which aÅ¿Å¿ures vs, that the Å¿on of God, hath died for vs: For what could it auaile vs, to Å¿ee our redemption, to Å¿ee our Å¿aluation, and our life, a farre off, if a way were not found out, &amp; a hand, and meanes giuen vnto vs, whereby wee may apprehend that Å¿aluation, and applie it to our Å¿elues. What can it auaile a Å¿icke man, to Å¿ee a drugge in an Apothecaries Å¿hoppe, except hee may haue it, and apply
<pb facs="tcp:20181:114"/>it to his Å¿icke bodie? So, to the ende that this worke of our redemption, and Å¿aluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may bee fully, and freely accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed: looke, how freely, hee hath giuen his onely Å¿onne, to the death of the croÅ¿Å¿e for vs; as freely hath hee found out this way, and meanes, and offered vs this hand, whereby wee may take hold on ChriÅ¿t, and applie him to our Å¿oules: This meanes, to conclude, is faith: There is not a way, nor an inÅ¿trument in the Scriptures of God whereby we can applie Chr. to our Å¿oules, but only the inÅ¿trument of faith: therfore, fayth cannot be enough co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mended. Turn to faith, &amp; it will make thee turne to God; &amp; Å¿o, conioyne thee with God, &amp; make all thine actions, well pleasÅ¿ing vnto him: There is no good actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that we do, though it Å¿eeme neuer Å¿o good, before the world, but it is abhomination before God if it be not done in fayth, and will forward our condemnation: hauing fayth, all the creatures of god, are Å¿eruiceable vnto vs, they muÅ¿t all conÅ¿pire to the furtherance, of the worke of our Å¿aluation: As on the contrarie, wanting fayth, there is none of the creatures of God, but Å¿hall bee ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto vs, and conÅ¿pire to our dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20181:114"/>For fayth conioynes vs, with the God of heauen, and makes vs heauenly: This Iewell of faith, Å¿eaÅ¿ons all the gifts, &amp; graces, which God giueth vnto vs: All the riches of the earth, is of no value to my Å¿oule, without fayth. And what auailes it any man, to haue all the knowledge, and wiÅ¿dome in the earth, without fayth? For the diuell hath all this knowledge, and is not the better. What auailes it me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all the Monarches, kingdomes, and whole riches in the earth: what can all theÅ¿e auaile my Å¿oule? Nothing but accuÅ¿e mee, if I want fayth. Therefore, all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and gifts of God, without faith auail nothing, but to augment our miÅ¿ery: All the gifts, and graces of God are abuÅ¿ed, without fayth: Fayth onely makes thee to vÅ¿e the benefits, and graces of God right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Fayth onely Å¿hould bee Å¿ought, kept, and intertained, heere in this life: hauing fayth, all the reÅ¿t of Gods graces, are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto thee, for this Iewell keeps them al in order, &amp; makes them al fruitful; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, wanting this iewel, there is nothing here on earth, but it wil teÅ¿tifie againÅ¿t thee.</p>
            <p>Let vs then Å¿peak of this faith, how it is wroght in you: I take my grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d out of the

<pb facs="tcp:20181:116"/>he taketh order with the minde: and what doth hee to the minde? he baniÅ¿heth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, he chaÅ¿ethout vanitie, and blindnes, that naturally lurketh in the mind; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teed of this darknes, he placeth in the minde, a light, a celeÅ¿tiall, and a heauenly light, a light which is reÅ¿ident in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us only: Then, the Å¿pirit chaÅ¿eth out that cloude of miÅ¿te, &amp; darknes, and placeth light in the minde. And what worketh he by this light? We getting this inward, and heauenly light in the minde, &amp; a Å¿anctified vnderÅ¿tanding, incontinent hee makes vs to Å¿ee God: not only as he is God the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the world; but alÅ¿o as hee is God the redeemer, and hath redeemed vs in his Å¿on ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us. Now before I obtaine this light, what is my heart, &amp; mind doing? There is not one of you, but haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as I my Å¿elfe haue, in what eÅ¿tate the heart, and minde is, before that this light enter: The minde lieth drowned in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and the heart is hardned, and they both conÅ¿pire together in vice, to Å¿ette vp an Idoll in Å¿tead of God, a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall and inuiÅ¿ible Idoll: what Å¿ort of Idoll is that? No doubt, Å¿ome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or fleÅ¿hly affection, or other: this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20181:116"/>is Å¿ette vp, in the throne of thy heart; and on this Idoll, thou beÅ¿toweÅ¿t the Å¿eruice of thy whole heart, of thy whole minde, of thy whole Å¿oule, and bodie: So, that the Å¿eruice both of the Å¿oule, and bodie, which Å¿hould be beÅ¿towed vpon God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is imployed vpon that Idoll, which is Å¿et vp in thy heart, that is, in the place of God, in the Å¿teed of the moÅ¿t high God: And thou art more addicted, to the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of that Idoll, then euer thou waÅ¿t, to the Å¿eruice of the liuing God: yea, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Å¿uch time, that this Idoll of ours bee baniÅ¿hed, and that this blindnes, whereby this Idoll is Å¿erued, be taken away, there is not one of you, but are Å¿eruants to one luÅ¿t or other; &amp; thy Å¿oule, that Å¿hould bee conÅ¿ecrated to the Å¿eruice of the liuing GOD, is imployed vpon one affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or other, vpon Å¿ome worldly or fleÅ¿hly luÅ¿t, of thine owne: But from the time, that the Lord beginneth to Å¿catter the cloudes of our naturall mindes, and vnderÅ¿tandings, and beginneth to chaÅ¿e away this thicke miÅ¿t, of the darke Å¿oule, and placeth therein, Å¿ome Å¿parke of heauenly light, which floweth out of Chr. and whereas we were children of the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:117"/>night, and darkneÅ¿Å¿e before hee makes vs to be light in the Lord, and to be children of the light, and of the day. Then we Å¿ee, that all the things in the world, beÅ¿ides the liuing God, are vanities, deceiueable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, vnconÅ¿tant Å¿hadowes, fleeting, and flowing without any abiding: and and then wee Å¿ee, that our hearts, and our mindes, were Å¿ette on euill continually. Then wee beginne to abhor that Idoll, and to Å¿eeke to Å¿erue God only. Now except the Lord of his mercie, and goodnes, place in vs this light, vntill Å¿uch time as we get Å¿ome glimmering of this light, wee canne neuer Å¿ee our own vanitie, nor yet Å¿ee God.</p>
            <p>This then is the firÅ¿t worke of the Å¿pirit, hee baniÅ¿heth darkneÅ¿Å¿e, and errors, and placeth light in our mindes. Now this firÅ¿t worke of the Å¿pirit, is tearmed oftentimes in the Scripture, vnder the name of fayth: for the minde hath it owne aÅ¿Å¿ent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waÅ¿ion in the owne kinde, as well as the heart hath: and therefore the minde bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing illuminate, &amp; Å¿eaÅ¿oned with this light, the aÅ¿Å¿enting, and knowledge in the Å¿ame minde, is called faith. The ApoÅ¿tles, and EuangeliÅ¿ts, giue to this knowledge, the name of fayth: for from the time, that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20181:117"/>thou once haÅ¿t an eye to Å¿ee God, &amp; whom he hath Å¿ent, ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, when once thou getteÅ¿t a Å¿ight of him, and acceÅ¿Å¿e to him, if it were no more then in the minde, it is called faith.</p>
            <p>But wee muÅ¿t not Å¿tand Å¿till heere: If faith goe no further then the minde, it is not the faith that wee are Å¿eeking. For the faith that iuÅ¿tifieth, and doth vs good, muÅ¿t open the hart, as well as it openeth the minde; it muÅ¿t baniÅ¿h that Idol and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection out of the hart, and in Å¿teed therof, place a throne for ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us. So, that except the good Å¿pirit of God, goe further then the minde, and baniÅ¿h this Idol, as vvell out of our hearts, as out of our mindes, we haue not that iuÅ¿tifying faith, wherby we may looke for mercy. Yea, the Å¿pirit of GOD muÅ¿t not onely Å¿tay at the inlightening of thy mind, but it muÅ¿t mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie this hart of thine, and change thine affections. And vvhereas thy affections were wicked, and euill, Gods Spirit muÅ¿t change thy will: and he neuer can change thy will, except he make the ground of thy hart good, that it may be Å¿et on God, and bring forth good fruit aboundantly to the owner.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:118"/>
            <p>And what teacheth this? This teacheth you to Å¿eeke for an honeÅ¿t hart, and to Å¿eeke inÅ¿tantly, while yee obtaine it. For, what auaileth it any man, to knowe vvhat is good, or what is euill, except hee haue a way Å¿hewed him, how hee Å¿hall eÅ¿chew the euill, &amp; a meanes giuen him, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe partaker of the good?</p>
            <p>Is not this an idle, and vnprofitable knowledge to mee, to Å¿ee a farre off, and to knowe that this is good for me, when I finde not a meanes, how to be partaker of that good, that it may be eÅ¿pecially good to mee? Is it not an idle knowledge alÅ¿o, to perceiue that this is ill for mee, that it vvill doe mee hurt if I doe it; and yet, that Å¿ame verie thing I vvill doe, and no other?</p>
            <p>So the Spirit of GOD, linketh theÅ¿e two together in this worke; and as hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the minde, hee reformes alÅ¿o the hart, and makes you to be partakers of that good, which yee Å¿ee; and to eÅ¿chew that euill which ye perceiue. And this is the Å¿econd worke of the Spirit, Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preÅ¿ent a thing to thee, but to make it thine in effect. For, howbeit the minde would doe his part neuer Å¿o well, and let
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20181:118"/>thee Å¿ee that ChriÅ¿t is thine, and preÅ¿ent him to thee neuer Å¿o often; yet if thy hart be not reformed, that will, and crooked affection that is in thy hart, will preferre it Å¿elfe to ChriÅ¿t, and vvill make thee to account all but folly, in reÅ¿pect of that Idol.</p>
            <p>And therefore, it were an idle, and a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h thing for mee to Å¿ee my Å¿aluation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I get grace to be partaker of it: and what auailes it thee, to Å¿ee the works of the diuell, to Å¿ee thine owne Å¿innes, that Å¿lay thee, except thou get grace to eÅ¿chew them? And Å¿o the Å¿econd worke of the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is this, Hee enters into the hart, hee daunteth the hart, and wonderfully chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, making the wil of it obedient: hee mollifies the affection, which was hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that it is made to poure out thy affection in Å¿om meaÅ¿ure, on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, wheras it was poured out on one Idol or other of thine owne before. Then, except the hart will do his part, as the mind doth his part, the whole Å¿oule is not conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to God: for God hath not made the Å¿oule, that the hart Å¿hould Å¿erue thee, and the mind only Å¿hold Å¿erue him; but thy Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is then only acceptable to God, when
<pb facs="tcp:20181:119"/>thou conÅ¿ecrateÅ¿t thy hart, as well as thy minde to him.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">A Å¿imili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of the corporall foode, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luÅ¿trate the Å¿pirituall.</note> this matter is Å¿o cleare, that it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to be illuÅ¿trated by Å¿imilitude: yet to make it more plaine vnto you, I vvill Å¿hew you by a Å¿imilitude, that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henÅ¿ion of the minde is not enough, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee get the apprehenÅ¿ion of the hart alÅ¿o. In corporall things, in meat &amp; drink, which Å¿erue for the vÅ¿e of your bodies, there muÅ¿t be of this meat and drinke, two Å¿orts of apprehenÅ¿ions: and as there is two Å¿orts of apprehenÅ¿ion, of the meat and drinke, that is the foode of the body: Å¿o there is two Å¿orts of apprehenÅ¿ion of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, which is our meate and drinke Å¿pirituall. Of meat and drinke corporall, there is an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henÅ¿ion by the eye, and by the taÅ¿te: that while the meate is preÅ¿ent vnto you on the Table, your eye taketh a view of that meat, diÅ¿cerneth it, and maketh choice of it: and not onely the eye, but alÅ¿o the taÅ¿te diÅ¿cerneth the meat, and the taÅ¿te ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing it, that is called the firÅ¿t appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henÅ¿ion.</p>
            <p>Now, vpon this which is the firÅ¿t, the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond apprehenÅ¿ion followeth: that is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20181:119"/>that ye haue chewed that meat, Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, &amp; Å¿ent it to your Å¿tomack, where it digeÅ¿teth, and conuerteth into your nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riture; then in your Å¿tomack, ye get the Å¿econd apprehenÅ¿ion. But if your eye like not that meat, neither your taÅ¿te like it, the Å¿econd apprehenÅ¿ion followeth not; for thou wilt Å¿pet it out againe, or reiect it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Å¿ome other meat vnto it, that thou likeÅ¿t better. That meat which thou likeÅ¿t not, enters neuer into thy Å¿tomack, and Å¿o it can neuer be conuerted into thy nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hment: for, it is onely the Å¿econd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenÅ¿ion of the meat, that is the cauÅ¿e of the nouriÅ¿hment of the body, in our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall foode; Å¿o that if yee chew not this meat, and Å¿wallow it, it feeds you not; then it is onely the Å¿econd apprehenÅ¿ion that nouriÅ¿heth our bodies.</p>
            <p>It is euen Å¿o in Å¿pirituall things (Å¿o farre as they may be compared) in the foode of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, who is the life, and nouriture of our Å¿oules and conÅ¿ciences. There muÅ¿t be two Å¿orts of apprehenÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us. The firÅ¿t apprehenÅ¿ion is, by the eye of the minde; that is, by our knowledge, &amp; vnderÅ¿tanding: for, as the eye of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, diÅ¿cerneth by an outward light; Å¿o the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:120"/>eye of the minde, diÅ¿cerneth by an inward, and renewed vnderÅ¿tanding, whereby wee get the firÅ¿t apprehenÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Now, if this firÅ¿t apprehenÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t like vs well, then the next followeth: Wee beginne to caÅ¿t the affection of our harts on him; we haue good will to him: for all our affections proceed from our will, and our affections beeing renewed, and made holy, wee Å¿ette them wholly vpon ChriÅ¿t. We loue him; and if we loue him, we take hold on him, we eate him, and digeÅ¿t him; that is, we apply him to our Å¿oules: and Å¿o, of this loue, and liking of him, the Å¿econd apprehenÅ¿ion doth follow. But if we haue no will to him, if wee haue no loue, nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him, what doe we? Then we reiect him, and preferre our owne Idol, and the Å¿eruice of our own affections, to him; and Å¿o the Å¿econd apprehenÅ¿ion followeth not. Wee cannot digeÅ¿t him; and if wee digeÅ¿t him not, that Å¿pirituall life cannot growe in vs: for marke, in vvhat place the eye Å¿erues to the bodie, in the Å¿ame roome, Å¿erueth knowledge, and vnderÅ¿tanding to thy Å¿oule: and looke in vvhat place, thy hand, and thy mouth, thy taÅ¿te, and thy Å¿tomack, Å¿erue vnto thy body, in that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20181:120"/>very place, Å¿erue the hart, and affections to thy Å¿oule.</p>
            <p>So that, as our bodies cannot be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed, except our hands take, and our mouthes eate the meate, whereby the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond apprehenÅ¿ion may follow: likewiÅ¿e, our Å¿oules cannot feede on ChriÅ¿t, except we hold him, and imbrace him hartilie, by our wills, and affections. For we come not to ChriÅ¿t, by any outward motion of our bodies, but by an inward motion, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenÅ¿ion of the hart. For God finding vs all in a reprobate Å¿enÅ¿e, he brings vs to ChriÅ¿t, by reforming the affection of our Å¿oules, by making vs to loue him. And therefore, the Å¿econd apprehenÅ¿ion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee digeÅ¿t our Sauiour, will neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into our Å¿oules, except, as hee pleaÅ¿eth the eye, Å¿o he pleaÅ¿e the will, and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alÅ¿o.</p>
            <p>Now, if this come to paÅ¿Å¿e, that our wills &amp; affections, are wholly bent vpon ChriÅ¿t; then, no doubt, vvee haue gotten this Iewell of faith. Haue yee Å¿uch a liking in your minds, and Å¿uch a loue in your harts of ChriÅ¿t, that ye will prefer him, before all things in the world? then, no queÅ¿tion, faith is begun in you.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:121"/>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">How faith is nouriÅ¿hed and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in vs.</note> after a thing is begunne, there is yet more required: for though this faith be formed in your mindes, in your harts, and Å¿oules, yet that is not enough; but that which is formed, muÅ¿t be nouriÅ¿hed; and hee who is conceiued, muÅ¿t be entertained and brought vp: or elÅ¿e, the loue that is begunne in mee, by the holy Å¿pirit, except by ordinary meanes it be daily entertained and nouriÅ¿hed, it will decay: except the Lord continue the working of his holie Spirit, it is not poÅ¿sible that I can continue in the faith.</p>
            <p>And how muÅ¿t we nouriÅ¿h, and continue faith in our Å¿oules? Two manner of waies. FirÅ¿t, wee nouriÅ¿h faith begunne in our Å¿oules, by hearing of the word; not of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie word, but by hearing of the vvord of God preached: and not by hearing of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, but by hearing the word preached by him that is Å¿ent. For this is the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie means wherunto the Lord hath bound himÅ¿elfe; hee will work faith, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, and the receiuing of the Sacraments. And the more that thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t the vvord, and the oftner that thou receiueÅ¿t the Sacraments, the more thy faith is nouriÅ¿hed.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:20181:121"/>
            <p>Now, it is not onely by hearing of the word, &amp; receiuing of the Sacraments, that we nouriÅ¿h faith. The word, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are not able of themÅ¿elues to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h this faith in vs, except the working of the holy Spirit be conioyned vvith their miniÅ¿tery. But the word, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are Å¿aid to nouriÅ¿h faith in our Å¿oules, becauÅ¿e they offer, and exhibite ChriÅ¿t vnto vs, who is the meat, the drink, and life of our Å¿oules: and in reÅ¿pect that in the word and Sacraments, wee get ChriÅ¿t, who is the foode of our Å¿oules, therefore the word and Sacraments, are Å¿aid to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h our Å¿oules. As it is Å¿aid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>The DiÅ¿ciples of ChriÅ¿t, continued in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles doctrine, and fellowÅ¿hippe, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, and prayers;</hi> by theÅ¿e means, entertaining, augmenting, and nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faith that was begunne in them. Then the holy Spirit begets this faith, works this faith, creates this faith, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿heth, and entertaineth this faith in our Å¿oules, by hearing of the word preached, and by the receiuing of the Sacraments: which are the ordinary meanes, whereby the Lord nouriÅ¿heth vs, and continueth this Å¿pirituall foode with vs. For, obÅ¿erue
<pb facs="tcp:20181:122"/>by what meanes the Å¿pirituall life is begun, by the Å¿ame meanes, it is nouriÅ¿hed, and entertained; as this temporall life is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and nouriÅ¿hed, by the Å¿ame meanes, whereby it is begun.</p>
            <p>Then Å¿eeing by theÅ¿e meanes,
<note place="margin">ConcluÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</note> the holy Spirit begets this vvorke of faith in our Å¿oules: It is our dutie to craue, that hee would continue the worke which hee hath begunne. And for this cauÅ¿e, we Å¿hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ort to the hearing of the vvord, when it is preached, and to the receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, when they are miniÅ¿tred, that we may be fedde in our Å¿oules to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laÅ¿ting.</p>
            <p>But alas, wee are come to Å¿uch a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diÅ¿daine, or reiecting of heauenly foode in this Countrey, that where men in the beginning, would haue gone, Å¿ome twentie miles, Å¿ome fortie miles, to the hearing of this vvord: they vvill Å¿carce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie novv, come from their houÅ¿es, to the Church, and remaine there but one houre to heare the vvord, but rather abide at home. VVell, I Å¿ay, too much vvealth vvith-drawes their hearts; and the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this vvord, ingenders Å¿uch a loathÅ¿omneÅ¿Å¿e, that it is a rare thing to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20181:122"/>finde out any, that haue that thirÅ¿t, and deÅ¿ire to heare the vvord, as they vvere wont to haue in the beginning.</p>
            <p>And for thoÅ¿e that are in higher places, they will heare it Å¿ildome, or not at all: for they cannot indure to heare the thing that accuÅ¿eth them, and conuicts them, and therefore they auoyde it. But they Å¿hould not doe Å¿o, they Å¿hould not Å¿hunne ChriÅ¿t, nor abÅ¿taine from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>is vvord that accuÅ¿eth them: but they Å¿hould heare the vvord; and as the vvord accuÅ¿eth them, they Å¿hould accuÅ¿e themÅ¿elues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o; that thereby, they may come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿sion of their Å¿inne, and obtaine mercy for the Å¿ame.</p>
            <p>So, vvhen ChriÅ¿t accuÅ¿eth thee, thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t not runne from him; but thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t draw neere to him; thou Å¿houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿t threaten kindneÅ¿Å¿e of him, and, as it vvere, make a breach, and forcible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into his kingdome. It is not the way, vvhen thy Å¿innes touch thee, and when ChriÅ¿t accuÅ¿eth thee, to runne from him: no, thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t then turne to him, thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e thy Å¿inne, cry <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caui,</hi> and Å¿eeke mercy: and after that thou haÅ¿t obtained mercy, this word Å¿hal becom
<pb facs="tcp:20181:123"/>as pleaÅ¿ant to thee, and thou Å¿halt take as great delight to come to the hearing of it, as euer thou delightedÅ¿t to flie from it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But alas! our lothÅ¿omneÅ¿Å¿e and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine is growen to Å¿uch an height, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am moued to belieue firmly, that the Lord hath concluded, that we Å¿hal not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his reÅ¿t, &amp; that onely for the great contempt of his mercy, and grace, which is now Å¿o richly offred. For why? God can not deale otherwiÅ¿e with vs, then hee dealt with our fore-fathers, the IÅ¿raelites, for the negligence of his vvord, vvhich was but then obÅ¿curely preached: for then it was farre from the incarnation of ChriÅ¿t; and the farther that it was from his incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the vvord was euer the more obÅ¿cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, vnder darke types, and Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. Yet notvvithÅ¿tanding, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that heard that word preached, and belieued it not, they periÅ¿hed all in the WilderneÅ¿Å¿e, except two; as ye haue Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time heard out of this place.</p>
            <p>And if they, for the contempt of Å¿o dark a light periÅ¿hed: much more muÅ¿t yee, that are their children periÅ¿h, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Å¿unne of righteouÅ¿nes, who is riÅ¿en Å¿o plainely, and Å¿hineth Å¿o cleerely

            <p>IN the doctrine of our triall, and due examination, the ApoÅ¿tle, as ye haue heard (vvel-beloued in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us) gaue vs a Å¿peciall commaund, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs, Å¿hould try, and examine narrowly our Å¿elues: that is, that euery man Å¿hould condiÅ¿cend, and enter into his owne conÅ¿cience, try, and examine the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate of his own conÅ¿cience, in what eÅ¿tate he findes it with God; and in what eÅ¿tate he findes it with his neighbour. Hee inioynes this triall to our Å¿elues, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mands, that euery one of vs Å¿hould take pains vpon the true examination of our conÅ¿ciences. Hee inioynes this work to vs, why? BecauÅ¿e no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20181:124"/>man knoweth Å¿o much of me, as I doe my Å¿elfe; becauÅ¿e no man can be Å¿ure of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate of my conÅ¿cience, but I my Å¿elfe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e no man can Å¿o diligently, nor Å¿o pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably try my conÅ¿cience, as I my Å¿elfe. Therefore, chiefely it behooueth euery man, and woman, before they enter to the hearing of the word, before they giue their eare to the vvord, or their mouth to the Sacrament; it behoueth them to try, and examine their owne conÅ¿ciences. Not, that the ApoÅ¿tle vvould Å¿eclude the triall of other men: for, as it is lawfull for mee, to try my Å¿elfe; Å¿o, no doubt, it is lawfull for my PaÅ¿tor to try mee. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for other men, that haue a care ouer mee, to try, and examine me: but no man can doe this Å¿o profitably to mee, as I my Å¿elfe. And though wee had neuer Å¿o many tryers and examiners, all is nothing, if wee try not our Å¿elues. So, whether there be a Å¿econd, or a third tryer, and examiner, let our Å¿elues be one, and the firÅ¿t. And no doubt, the ApoÅ¿tles minde was this, To let vs Å¿ee clearlie, that hee that commeth to that Table, and hath not that knowledge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>or is not of that ability to try him-Å¿elfe, is a profane commer, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth vncleanly;
<pb facs="tcp:20181:125"/>and therefore, muÅ¿t needs come to his owne deÅ¿truction. Let euery man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore growe in knowledge, growe in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding, growe in the Å¿pirit, that hee may be the more able, to try, and examine his owne conÅ¿cience.</p>
            <p>To the end that ye may goe forward, &amp; proceed in the worke of this triall, with the better Å¿peed, and with the better fruits; in this examination, we laid down this order. FirÅ¿t of all, I Å¿hewed, what that is which we call a conÅ¿cience, and what is meant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Next, I declared, for what cauÅ¿es yee Å¿hould put your conÅ¿ciences to this triall, and narrow examination. And thirdlie, Å¿o farre as time Å¿uffered, I entred into the points, wherein euery one of you Å¿hould try, and examine your owne conÅ¿ciences. As for conÅ¿cience, that yee may call that definition to your memory, I will reÅ¿ume it Å¿hortlie. We call a conÅ¿cience, a certain feeling in the hart, reÅ¿embling the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudgement of GOD, following vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a deed done by vs, flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the mind. A feeling, accompanied with a motion in the hart; a motion, either of feare, or ioy, trembling, or reioycing. I leaue the opening vp of theÅ¿e parts, to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20181:125"/>your memories, and I pray God, that they may be well Å¿anctified. I come next, to the cauÅ¿es, wherefore euerie one of you Å¿hould bee carefull in trying, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your owne conÅ¿ciences. The firÅ¿t cauÅ¿e is, becauÅ¿e the Lord of heauen, hath his eye continually vpon the conÅ¿cience: the eye of God, is neuer from the conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and heart of man, as I proued to you by diuerÅ¿e places. Next, becauÅ¿e this God hath choÅ¿en his lodging, and hath Å¿et downe his throne, to make his reÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the conÅ¿cience: Therefore, that hee may dwell in cleaneneÅ¿Å¿e, yee ought to haue a regard to his dwelling place. Thirdly, he is the Lord, yea, the only Lord of this conÅ¿cience, who hath power onely to controle, who only hath power to Å¿aue, or to caÅ¿t away: therefore, that it may doe good Å¿eruice, to thy owne Lord, thou oughteÅ¿t to take heed to thy conÅ¿cience. And laÅ¿t of all, in reÅ¿pect that the health of thy Å¿oule, Å¿tandeth in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate of thy conÅ¿cience, and if thy Å¿oule be in good health, thy bodie cannot bee ill: Therefore, in reÅ¿pect that the Å¿oule, and bodie, depend vpon the eÅ¿tate of the conÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, euery one of you, Å¿hould careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:20181:126"/>looke to your conÅ¿ciences: I will not amplifie this, but leaue it to your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: how the health of the Å¿oule, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Å¿oule, Å¿hould be kept. Next, I come in the third, and laÅ¿t place to the points, in the which, euerie one of you, Å¿hould trie, and examine your conÅ¿ciences. And as yee may remember, I Å¿et downe two points, wherein ye ought to put your conÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences in triall: FirÅ¿t, to know whether your conÅ¿ciences were at peace with God, or not: Secondly, whether your conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, were in loue, in charitie, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with your neighbour, or not: In theÅ¿e two points cheefly, yee muÅ¿t trie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your Å¿elues. To know, whether ye bee at peace with God, or not, ye muÅ¿t firÅ¿t trie, whether yee be in the faith or not (as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith) whether yee bee in the faith of ChriÅ¿t, or not: For being in the faith, and iuÅ¿tified thereby, on necesÅ¿itie, yee muÅ¿t haue peace with God. Then the next care muÅ¿t bee, to try your faith, and to Å¿ee whether ye haue faith, or not. Faith can no waies be tried, but by the fruits: faith cannot be iudged on by me, that looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it only, but by the effects. Therefore, to try whether ye be in the faith or not, mark
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20181:126"/>the fruits; Take heed to thy mouth, take heed to thy hand, take heede to thy words, and to thy deeds: for except thou glorifie God in thy mouth, and confeÅ¿Å¿e to thy Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; except thou glorifie him alÅ¿o in thy deedes, &amp; make thy holy life, a witnes of thy holy faith, all is but vaine, all is but meere hypocriÅ¿ie:
<note place="margin">How a Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere faith is knowen.</note> Therefore to knowe the Å¿inceritie of thy faith, thou muÅ¿t take heede, that there be a harmonie, between thy hand, thy mouth, and thy hart, that there be a natural conÅ¿ent, that thy doings preiudge not thy hart, that thy mouth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge not thy heart, but that mouth, and hand may teÅ¿tifie, the Å¿inceritie of the hart: If the heart, the hand, &amp; the mouth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, &amp; agree in one harmonie together; No queÅ¿tion, that heart that breakes forth into Å¿o good fruits, is coupled with God; There is no queÅ¿tion, the light of thy actions, the beames and Å¿hining of thy life, Å¿hall make the name of thy good God, to bee glorified.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the whole weight of our triall, Å¿tandes cheefely vpon this point, to Å¿ee whether wee bee in the fayth, or not; to trie and examine, whether ChriÅ¿t dwell in vs by fayth, or not:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:127"/>for without fayth, there canne be no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, or conioyning betwixt vs, &amp; ChriÅ¿t; without faith, our hearts cannot bee Å¿anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and cleanÅ¿ed; and without faith, we cannot worke by charitie: Å¿o all depends, on this onely. And therefore that yee might the better vnderÅ¿tand, whether yee haue fayth, or no: I was Å¿omewhat the more exact in this matter, and I beganne to let you Å¿ee, how the holy Å¿pirit createth faith, &amp; works faith in your Å¿oules, hearts, and mindes: I began to Å¿hewe you, what order the holy Å¿pirit kept, in forming, and in creating this notable inÅ¿trument, in your hearts, and mindes. Not onely, how hee ingenders, and begins fayth, but alÅ¿o, how he intertaines it, how he nouriÅ¿heth it. And I Å¿hewed you, the externall means, and inÅ¿truments, which hee vÅ¿eth to this effect: To beget faith in our Å¿oules, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿pirit vÅ¿eth the hearing of the word, preached by him that is Å¿ent, &amp; the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿terie of the Sacraments, as ordinarie meanes, and inÅ¿truments: which ordinary meanes, are onely then effectuall, when as the holy Å¿pirit, concurs inwardly in our hearts, with the word Å¿triking outwardly in our eares, and with the Sacrament out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20181:127"/>receiued: And except the holy Å¿pirit grant his concurrence to the word, and Sacrament; word, and Sacrament both will not worke faith. So, all depends, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the working of this holy Å¿pirit: The whole regeneration of mankind, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the heart, and of the conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, depend on the power of the holy Å¿pirit; And therefore it behoueth vs, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to imploy our Å¿elues, in calling vpon God for his holy Å¿pirit. By the Å¿ame means, and no other, that the holy Å¿pirit beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ts faith in vs, by the Å¿ame meanes, hee nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿heth, and augments that, which hee hath begotten: And therefore, as we got faith by the hearing of the word, Å¿o by continuall, and diligent hearing, we haue this faith augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted, &amp; nouriÅ¿hed in vs. And from hence I tooke my exhortation, That if yee would haue that Å¿pirituall life nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hed in you, and if yee would haue a further aÅ¿Å¿urance of heauen; of neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itie, yee muÅ¿t both continually, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, heare the bleÅ¿Å¿ed word of God.</p>
            <p>Now it reÅ¿teth, that euery one of you carefully apply this doctrine to your owne Å¿oules, and enter into the triall of your owne conÅ¿ciences, To Å¿ee if this faith,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:128"/>as I Å¿pake, be begunne in your hearts, and mindes, or not: how farre, or how little, the holy Å¿pirit hath proceeded in that worke, trie with mee, and I with you. The firÅ¿t effect of the holy Å¿pirit, whereby yee may trie your mindes, whether yee be in the faith, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> not, is this: Reuolue in your memories, and remember, if at any time, it pleaÅ¿ed the Lord, in his mercie, to turn the darkneÅ¿Å¿e of your mindes into light, to cauÅ¿e that naturall darkneÅ¿Å¿e, which was within you, to depart: Through the which darkneÅ¿Å¿e, neyther had yee an eye, to Å¿ee your Å¿elues, what you were by nature, nor yet had ye an eye, to Å¿ee God in ChriÅ¿t, nor anie parte of his mercie. Examine I Å¿ay, whether this darkneÅ¿Å¿e of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnderÅ¿tanding, bee turned into light, by the working of the Å¿pirit, or not: If thou art become a childe of the light, a childe of the day; If thou art become (as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaketh) light in the Lord: If there bee this alteration made in thy minde; That whereas naturally before, it was cloÅ¿ed vp in darkneÅ¿Å¿e, whereas it was filled with vanities, and errors, wherens it was cloÅ¿ed vp, in blindnes: If the Lord hath at anie time, inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20181:128"/>the eye of thy minde, and made thee to Å¿ee thine owne miÅ¿erie, to Å¿ee the vglineÅ¿Å¿e of thine owne nature, to Å¿ee the heinous Å¿ins, in the which by nature thou lieÅ¿t; If hee hath granted to thee, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ight of thy Å¿elfe, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure; and on the other Å¿ide, if hee hath granted thee the remedie, and hath giuen thee, an inÅ¿ight of the mercie of God, in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, if thou haÅ¿t obtained an inÅ¿ight of the riches of his grace in ChriÅ¿t; No doubt, the holy Å¿pirit hath begunne a good worke worke in thee: A worke, which will bring forth repentance, which in his owne time, hee will perfect: So this is the firÅ¿t care, which yee ought to haue, and the firÅ¿t point, wherein yee ought to examine your minds, To Å¿ee, if there bee any light in it, whereby, yee may know your miÅ¿erie, and haue an inÅ¿ight of the free mercie of God, in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us. This being done, that thou findeÅ¿t a Å¿ight of theÅ¿e two in thy minde, from thy minde goe to thy heart: and as thou haÅ¿t tryed thy minde, Å¿o try thy heart: And firÅ¿t, examine thine heart, if it bee altered, or not, that the will of it, bee framed, and bowed to GODs
<pb facs="tcp:20181:129"/>obedience, that thy affection bee turned into the life of God, and bee poured out on him, as it was poured out on vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, on filthineÅ¿Å¿e, and on the world before. Try, whether the ground of thy heart, and the fountaine from whence thy motions, and affections proceede, bee Å¿anctified, or not: for from a holy fountaine, holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muÅ¿t diÅ¿till: from a holy fountaine, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions, holy cogitations, and Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied conÅ¿iderations, muÅ¿t flowe.</p>
            <p>Trie then, and examine your hearts, if the Å¿pirit of God hath wrought any Å¿uch reformation, as I Å¿peake of in your harts, or not. And that ye may perceiue the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the holy Spirit the better in your hearts, and conÅ¿ciences (for the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath his chiefe reÅ¿idence in your hearts) I will declare vnto you, the firÅ¿t effect, that euer the holy Å¿pirit bringeth forth in the heart, in framing it, in molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it, and in bowing it, vnto the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God: You Å¿hall knowe the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Å¿pirit, by this effect: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if your mindes Å¿ee, and behold, what is ill; Å¿ee, and behold what is good; perceiue, and diÅ¿cerne your owne miÅ¿erie, and your Å¿innes, which haue brought this miÅ¿erie
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20181:129"/>vpon you; and withall perceiue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, the riches of the mercie of God in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us: If as your mindes Å¿ee theÅ¿e two, your hearts be reformed &amp; prepared to loue the Å¿ight of them: and as you Å¿ee in your mindes the mercy of God, and that in ChriÅ¿t, if yee haue hearts, to deÅ¿ire mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if ye haue a thirÅ¿ting, and earneÅ¿t deÅ¿ire, to be partakers of mercy; where this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire, and thirÅ¿t is, there the holy Å¿pirit is, hee hath no doubt, opened the heart: On the other Å¿ide if, as thou Å¿eeÅ¿t mercie, thou Å¿eeÅ¿t thy miÅ¿erie; if, as thy mind Å¿eeth thy miÅ¿erie, it Å¿eeth alÅ¿o the fountaine, from whence thy miÅ¿erie floweth, to wit, from thine owne Å¿innes; if then, thy hart alÅ¿o hate this, the holy Å¿pirit is there; if as thou Å¿eeÅ¿t Å¿inne, which is the cauÅ¿e of thy miÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with the eye, which is giuen thee in the minde; thou hateÅ¿t this Å¿inne with thy heart, no queÅ¿tion, the holy Å¿pirit is there: And as thou hateÅ¿t it, if alÅ¿o thou Å¿orrowe for it (for it is not enough to hate it, if thou lament not the committing of it, and with a godly Å¿orrowe deplore it) the holy Å¿pirit is there. And thirdly, if with thy lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, thou haÅ¿t a care, and a Å¿tudy to eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew that Å¿in, (for what auailes it to lament,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:130"/>if, like a dogge, returning to his vomit, thou fall into that Å¿ame gulfe againe?) Therefore, where there is an hatred of Å¿inne, a Å¿orrow for Å¿inne, a care, and a Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to eÅ¿chewe Å¿inne; no queÅ¿tion, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿pirit, hath opened the heart, and is working out that pretious inÅ¿trument. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue all this in a word, all the operation of the holy Å¿pirit, and working in the hart, and by this, examine thine heart: See, and perceiue, if the holy Å¿pirit hath entred Å¿o farre in thee, to worke in that hard heart of thine, an earneÅ¿t, and a diligent Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, a carefull Å¿olicitude, continually to bee reconciled with the great God, whom thou haÅ¿t offended: Is there Å¿uch a thing, as a thirÅ¿t, as a deÅ¿ire, to bee at amitie with him, whom thou haÅ¿t offended, to bee reconciled with the God of heauen, whom thou haÅ¿t offended by thy manifold tranÅ¿gresÅ¿ions? where this care and Å¿tudy of reconciliation is, if this care, and Å¿tudy, of reconciliation bee in the heart, there is no doubt, but the heart that thirÅ¿teth for this reconciliation, is heartily content not onely to renounce Å¿inne, to renounce all the impieties, that Å¿eparated thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> God; but, the heart that is indued with this thirÅ¿t,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20181:130"/>wil be hartily content, to renounce it Å¿elfe, to caÅ¿t downe it Å¿elfe, as Å¿tubborne as it was before, to caÅ¿t downe it Å¿elfe, at the feete of the mightie God, and be wholly content, at all times after, to be ruled by his holy will: Not to follow it owne luÅ¿t, it owne will, and appetite, as it did before, but to reÅ¿igne it Å¿elfe, wholly into the handes of the mightie God, to bee ruled by his will, at his pleaÅ¿ure, and to obey his commaundes. And except yee finde this diÅ¿poÅ¿ition in your owne hearts, To acquite your Å¿elues, to renounce your Å¿elues, it is a vaine thing for you to Å¿ay, that yee haue a thirÅ¿t to bee reconciled: So, the greater thirÅ¿t of reconciliation that we haue, &amp; the more that the care, &amp; Å¿tudy ther of groweth, the greater that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henÅ¿ion of my miÅ¿erie, of the deep gulfes, and very hels (whereunto my Å¿oule is Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect) increaÅ¿eth in my Å¿oule the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t would would I be, to bee reconciled: And to bee reconciled, I would not Å¿tand, for the renouncing, of the luÅ¿ts of my heart, but I wold renounce my hart, &amp; the obedience of the wil, &amp; deÅ¿ire: why? BecauÅ¿e I Å¿ee I muÅ¿t die for euer except the Lord reconcile himÅ¿elf with me: I Å¿ee the huge
<pb facs="tcp:20181:131"/>deepes, and oceans of all miÅ¿erie, into the which I Å¿hall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al in the ende, except in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the Lord reconcile himÅ¿elfe with me. To eÅ¿chewe theÅ¿e miÅ¿eries, and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is there any queÅ¿tion, but the hart, that hath any Å¿enÅ¿e, and is touched with them, will moÅ¿t willingly endeuour, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite it Å¿elfe? Againe, Å¿eeing the Lord hath taken paines, to deliuer mee out of that deepe miÅ¿erie, in the which I had drowned my Å¿elfe, and hath purchaÅ¿ed my redemption, by Å¿o deere a price, not with golde, nor with Å¿iluer, or any droÅ¿Å¿e on the earth, but by Å¿uch a wonderfull means, by Å¿uch a pretious price, and rich ranÅ¿ome; Looking to the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of our miÅ¿ery, and to the greatnes of the price, whereby hee hath redeemed vs, What heart is it, but would willingly renounce it Å¿elfe, to get a part of that redemption, and to be deliuered out of that hell, wherein wee are preÅ¿ently, and wherein wee Å¿hall be in a greater meaÅ¿ure heereafter, except wee bee reconciled? So then with this, there is ioyned a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>poÅ¿ition in the heart, whereby the heart is willing in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, to renounce it Å¿elfe.</p>
            <p>This leÅ¿Å¿on is often taught vs by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20181:131"/>our Sauiour ChriÅ¿t, wee muÅ¿t both take vp the croÅ¿Å¿e, and renounce our Å¿elues alÅ¿o, before that wee canne follow him. The more that this thirÅ¿t groweth in the heart, the more this renouncing of our Å¿elues groweth in the heart: the more that this thirÅ¿t decayeth, and is diminiÅ¿hed in the heart, the more, wee cleaue to the world, the more wee loue the fleÅ¿h, and the more are wee ruled and guided by them: So, eyther wee muÅ¿t nouriÅ¿h a thirÅ¿t of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, a hunger of life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting, a thirÅ¿t of mercie, a hunger after that iuÅ¿tice, that is in ChriÅ¿t, or it is not posÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in any meaÅ¿ure, wee can bee his diÅ¿ciples.</p>
            <p>Now to proceede: The heart, that after this manner is prepared, that with a thirÅ¿t to bee reconciled, is reÅ¿olued alÅ¿o to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it Å¿elfe, This heart, in the which there remaineth Å¿o earneÅ¿t a thirÅ¿t, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fruÅ¿trate of the expectation, is neuer diÅ¿appointed; But as the Lord hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it, an earneÅ¿t Å¿tudie to be reconciled, and to lay hold on ChriÅ¿t: So in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eie, hee grants vnto that heart, the poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿esÅ¿ion of mercie; hee puts that heart in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure in poÅ¿Å¿esÅ¿ion of mercy,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:132"/>which it Å¿eeketh, in poÅ¿Å¿esÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us himÅ¿elfe, whom it Å¿eeketh: The which apprehenÅ¿ion which it hath of Chr. the heart Å¿enÅ¿iblie feeleth, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in that peace, which hee giueth to the conÅ¿cience: So that the conÅ¿cience, which was terrified, exceedingly gnawen, and diÅ¿tracted before; by the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of this peace, &amp; of ChriÅ¿t with his graces, incontinent it is quieted, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, there commeth a calmeneÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e into the heart, and all troubles, and Å¿tormes are remoued: with this peace, is conioyned a taÅ¿te of the powers of the world to come; The heart gets a taÅ¿te of the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e that is in ChriÅ¿t, of the ioy, which is in the life euerlaÅ¿ting, which taÅ¿t is the onely earneÅ¿t pennie of that full and perfect ioye, which Å¿oule, and bodie in that life Å¿hall inioye: And the earneÅ¿t pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (as yee know) muÅ¿t bee a part of the Å¿umme, &amp; of the nature of the reÅ¿t of the Å¿umme: And therefore that earneÅ¿t penny of ioy, aÅ¿Å¿ures vs, that when wee Å¿hall get poÅ¿Å¿esÅ¿ion of the whole Å¿umme, it it Å¿hal be a Å¿trange ioy: And theÅ¿e documents lift vp the heart, and make it, not to linger, nor wearie in the expectation of that life:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20181:132"/>but being refreÅ¿hed now, and then, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, by Å¿o many earneÅ¿t pennies, they aÅ¿Å¿ure vs, of the full fruition of that ioye, for the which in patience wee will Å¿uÅ¿taine all troubles: So, as the holy Å¿pirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket a thirÅ¿t in vs, to bee with ChriÅ¿t, a thirÅ¿t of mercy, and reconciliation with him; The Å¿ame holy Å¿pirit diÅ¿appointeth not that Å¿ame expectation, and thirÅ¿t, but putteth the Å¿oule and heart in poÅ¿Å¿esÅ¿ion of ChriÅ¿t, by the which the conÅ¿cience is pacified, the heart is reioyced, and we get a taÅ¿te of the Å¿weetnes, and of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that life to come: The Å¿enÅ¿ible fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the which taÅ¿te, that paÅ¿Å¿eth all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vnderÅ¿tanding, what doth it in my heart and conÅ¿cience? It worketh a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull aÅ¿Å¿urance, and perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, that God loueth mee: The feeling of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in the bowels of my heart, in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of my conÅ¿cience, worketh a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aÅ¿Å¿urance, and perÅ¿waÅ¿ion that he is my God, that he will Å¿aue me, for ChriÅ¿ts cauÅ¿e, that the promiÅ¿e of mercie, which I durÅ¿t not apply vnto my conÅ¿cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce before; now, by the feeling of mercy I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applie, and Å¿ay mercie appertaineth to me; life, &amp; Å¿aluation belongeth to me:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:133"/>For the conÅ¿cience being exceedingly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and Å¿eeing nothing in God, but fire, and wrath, it is not posÅ¿ible, but it muÅ¿t Å¿he from him, it cannot approche to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uming fire. But from the time, that the conÅ¿cience getteth a taÅ¿te of this peace, mercy, and Å¿weetnes; how faÅ¿t Å¿oeuer it fled from the preÅ¿ence of God before, now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this reconciliation, it will runne as faÅ¿t to him, and will poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e him, more and more fully. So the aÅ¿Å¿urance, and perÅ¿wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of mercie, ariÅ¿eth from the feeling of mercie, in the hart, and conÅ¿cience. And except the heart feele it, and taÅ¿te it in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, no conÅ¿cience dare apply God and his mercie, to it Å¿elfe: I may be Å¿ure in generall, that all my Å¿innes are remiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible, and that I may obtaine mercie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I feele it: But, to applie this mercy, particularly to my Å¿elfe, vntill I feele a taÅ¿te of it, I dare not: So, this particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, whereby wee claime God, and ChriÅ¿t, as a propertie to vs, as if no man had title to him, but wee, and to call him my God, my ChriÅ¿t; and to claime his promiÅ¿es, as if no man had intereÅ¿t in them, but wee; This commeth of the Å¿ence, and feeling of mercie, in the hart:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20181:133"/>and the more that this feeling grovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the greater experience that we haue in our owne harts of this peace and mercy, the more increaÅ¿eth our faith and aÅ¿Å¿urance. Our perÅ¿waÅ¿ion becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Å¿o Å¿trong, that wee dare at the laÅ¿t Å¿ay with the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>What can Å¿eparate vs from the loue of GOD? Neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preÅ¿ent, nor things to come, Å¿hall be able to Å¿eparate me, from the loue of GOD, which is in ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This particular application, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿eth (no doubt) vpon the feeling, and Å¿enÅ¿e of mercie, is the Å¿peciall difference, the chiefe mark, and proper note, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our faith, vvho are iuÅ¿tified in the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, is diÅ¿cerned from that generall faith of the PapiÅ¿ts. Our faith, by this particular application, is not onely diÅ¿cerned from the generall faith of the PapiÅ¿ts, but it is diÅ¿cerned from all the pretended faiths of all the Sects in the world. For, the PapiÅ¿t dareth not apply the promiÅ¿e of mercie to his owne Å¿oule: he accounteth it preÅ¿umption, to
<pb facs="tcp:20181:134"/>Å¿ay, <hi>I am an elect, I am Å¿aued, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tified.</hi> And from whence floweth this? Onely from hence; That in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences, they haue neuer felt mercie, they haue neuer taÅ¿ted of the loue, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and Å¿weetnes of God. For, looke hovv faÅ¿t the conÅ¿cience flieth from GOD, before it gette the taÅ¿te of his Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e; it runneth as diligently to him, and threatneth loue on him, after that it hath gotten that taÅ¿te.</p>
            <p>So, they, miÅ¿erable men, content themÅ¿elues with this generall faith, which is no other thing but an hiÅ¿tori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call faith, which groundeth onely on the truth of GOD; whereby I knowe, that the promiÅ¿es of God, are true. But the PapiÅ¿ts dare not come, and Å¿ay, They are true in mee. Why? BecauÅ¿e they haue not felt it; and their harts are not opened. But our iuÅ¿tifying faith, as I told you, conÅ¿ecrateth the whole Å¿oule, vnto the obedience of God, in ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>So that it reÅ¿teth not onely vpon the truth of GOD, nor it reÅ¿teth not onely vpon the power of God, (though theÅ¿e be two chiefe pillars of our faith alÅ¿o)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20181:134"/>but eÅ¿pecially, and chiefely, it reÅ¿teth vpon the mercy of God, in ChriÅ¿t. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teth alÅ¿o, vpon the truth, and power of God; but eÅ¿pecially, vpon the promiÅ¿e of grace, and mercy in ChriÅ¿t. The Å¿oule of the PapiÅ¿t, beeing deÅ¿titute of the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and taÅ¿te of mercy, dare not enter into this particular application, &amp; Å¿o he cannot be iuÅ¿tified. Yea, no doubt, Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, as are iuÅ¿tified in the mercy of God, get a taÅ¿te of this mercy &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, before they depart this life. Thus farre concerning the effects.</p>
            <p>Then yee haue onely this to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; The opening of the hart, the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying &amp; quieting of the conÅ¿cience, they worke an aÅ¿Å¿urance &amp; a Å¿trong perÅ¿waÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mercy of God, in ChriÅ¿t. The more that the hart is opened, the more that the conÅ¿cience is pacified, the more that the taÅ¿te of that Å¿weetnes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and remaineth, the more art thou aÅ¿Å¿ured of Gods mercy. So then, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿t thou knowe whether thy faith be Å¿trong, or not, vvhether thy perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of Gods mercy be Å¿ure, or not? Looke to thy conÅ¿cience.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:135"/>
            <p>If thy conÅ¿cience be wounded, aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly thou vvilt doubt: and if thou doubteÅ¿t, thou canÅ¿t not haue Å¿uch a Å¿trong perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, as otherwiÅ¿e thou wouldeÅ¿t haue, if thy doubting were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued. Not, that I will haue faith to be Å¿o perfect in this life, that there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies no doubting ioyned with it; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not that perfection: but, I Å¿ay, that a wounded conÅ¿cience muÅ¿t euer doubt; and the more wee doubt, the leÅ¿Å¿e is our perÅ¿waÅ¿ion. So, the more that thou woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿t thy conÅ¿cience, the leÅ¿Å¿e faith thou haÅ¿t. Then thou muÅ¿t come to this poynt; Keepe a Å¿ound conÅ¿cience; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine peace in thy conÅ¿cience; &amp; thou Å¿halt keepe faith, and Å¿halt haue thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waÅ¿ion in that Å¿ame meaÅ¿ure, that thou haÅ¿t of reÅ¿t and peace in thy conÅ¿cience: and the more that thy conÅ¿cience is at peace and reÅ¿t, the greater Å¿hal thy faith and perÅ¿waÅ¿ion be.</p>
            <p>So, this ground is certaine; A doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conÅ¿cience, cauÅ¿eth a weake faith; and the more the doubting in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience is, the weaker is thy faith. Then true it is, that the ApoÅ¿tle faith, That
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20181:135"/>faith dwelleth in a good conÅ¿cience; that faith is locked, and cloÅ¿ed vp in a good conÅ¿cience. So that if yee keepe a good conÅ¿cience, ye Å¿hall keepe a Å¿trong faith: and if yee wound your conÅ¿ciences, yee Å¿hall wound your faith.</p>
            <p>Novv, to make this more Å¿enÅ¿ible; How can I be perÅ¿waded of his mercie, whoÅ¿e anger I feele kindled againÅ¿t me; and againÅ¿t whom, my conÅ¿cience Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, that I am guilty of many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. No queÅ¿tion, Å¿o long as the Å¿enÅ¿e of his anger, &amp; feeling of my offences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, I cannot haue a Å¿ure perÅ¿waÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that hee will be mercifull vnto mee: but, when I get acceÅ¿Å¿e vnto his preÅ¿ence, and a Å¿ight that hee hath forgiuen mee, then I begin to be Å¿urely perÅ¿waded. So then, keepe a good conÅ¿cience, and thou Å¿hall keepe faith; and the better that thy conÅ¿cience is, the Å¿urer vvill thy faith be.</p>
            <p>Then,
<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the whole exhortation that we gather from this point, dependeth vpon this; That euery one of you, in vvhat rank Å¿oeuer ye be, take heed vnto your conÅ¿ciences: for loÅ¿ing it, yee loÅ¿e faith;
<pb facs="tcp:20181:136"/>and loÅ¿ing faith, yee loÅ¿e Å¿aluation. Are ye in the ranke of great, and rich men? yee ought to take heed vnto your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences: eÅ¿pecially, in reÅ¿pect that the Lord hath placed you in a higher cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Ye haue many things wherein yee ought to controle your conÅ¿ciences; ye ought to craue the aduiÅ¿e of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences, before yee attempt any great worke, in reÅ¿pect that yee are bound in manifold duties to God, &amp; to your infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioure.</p>
            <p>And no doubt, if Å¿ome great men had aduiÅ¿ed well with their conÅ¿ciences, Å¿uch diÅ¿Å¿olutions had not fallen out in their owne houÅ¿es, Å¿uch oppreÅ¿sions of the poor, deadly feudes with men of their own rank, would not haue burÅ¿t forth in Å¿o high a meaÅ¿ure. But the Lord, Å¿eeing them take Å¿o little care vnto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences, depriueth them of faith, and of the hope of mercy; and their end will be miÅ¿erable. Yee Å¿hall Å¿ee, that the GOD of heauen, will make thoÅ¿e who liue Å¿o diÅ¿Å¿olutely, Å¿pectacles of his iudgements vnto the world; for, the Lord leaueth not Å¿uch men vnpuniÅ¿hed.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:20181:136"/>
            <p>By their examples, it vvere very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arie, that men of inferiour ranke Å¿hould take heede vnto their conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: and therefore, iet euery man, according vnto his calling, examine his calling, by the rule of his conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Let the Iudges, before they giue, and pronounce foorth Iudgement, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiÅ¿e vvith their conÅ¿ciences, &amp; the lavv thereof; and in Iudgement, not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their affections, but to follow the rule of their conÅ¿ciences. LikevviÅ¿e, they that are of inferiour degree vnto Iudges, let them controle their dooings, by their conÅ¿ciences; and giue not the poore Å¿ubiects iuÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to complaine on them. Let them not terrifie them, from the pleading of IuÅ¿tice, by exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant prices, and extraordinarie kinde of dealings: but let them moderate all their actions Å¿o, that they agree vvith the rule of their conÅ¿ciences; that Å¿o far as in them lyeth, IuÅ¿tice ceaÅ¿e not. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e the Merchants; let not them looke Å¿o much, to this, or that, as to the conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is in them; what in conÅ¿cience
<pb facs="tcp:20181:137"/>they may doe, according vnto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of knowledge, that GOD hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in them; and whatÅ¿oeuer they doe, let them beware that they doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t their knowledge.</p>
            <p>I grant their knowledge, will not be Å¿o learned as it Å¿hould be; and this maketh many deformed actions: yet, let no man doe againÅ¿t his knowledge; but let euery man doe, according vnto the meaÅ¿ure of knowledge wherewith God hath indued him. And, though it be not well refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet do not any thing by gueÅ¿Å¿e, but aduiÅ¿e well with thy conÅ¿cience, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy knowledge: for, that which is done doubtingly, is Å¿inne. So, whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou dooÅ¿t, let not thy eye, thy hand, nor any member of thy body, doe againÅ¿t thy knowledge: for this is a Å¿teppe to that high Å¿inne againÅ¿t the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie GhoÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>This is the ready way to put all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge out of your mindes: for if men do againÅ¿t knowledge, and continue in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againÅ¿t knowledge; at the laÅ¿t, they will become a maÅ¿Å¿e of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, the Lord will Å¿crape out all knowledge out
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20181:137"/>of their mindes, and all feeling of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy out of their harts. Therefore let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man follow his knowledge: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaÅ¿ure of his knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, let his actions proceed.</p>
            <p>It hath pleaÅ¿ed the Lord,
<note place="margin">Faith is the free gift of God.</note> to poure this liquor, this precious ointment into vs: though we be earthly, and fraile veÅ¿Å¿els, miÅ¿erable creatures, yet it hath pleaÅ¿ed our gracious God, to poure Å¿uch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious liquour into our harts and minds; and to credit Å¿uch a Iewell in our kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that by vertue thereof, wee may take hold on ChriÅ¿t; who is our iuÅ¿tice, our wiÅ¿edome, Å¿anctification, &amp; redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Though vvee be miÅ¿erable creatures, yet the Lord of his mercy hath a reÅ¿pect to vs, in ChriÅ¿t, in giuing vs this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquour, whereby our Å¿oules may be Å¿eaÅ¿oned to life euerlaÅ¿ting. In this, that he poures it into our harts, we Å¿ee cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it growes not in our harts, nor breedes not in our nature. No, this gift of faith, is not at mans commaund, nor vnder his arbitrement, as if it were in his power, to belieue, or not to belieue, as
<pb facs="tcp:20181:138"/>hee pleaÅ¿eth. It is the gift of God, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe freely, of his vndeÅ¿erued grace, in the riches of his mercie in ChriÅ¿t. That it is a gift, yee Å¿ee clearlie, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. vvhere the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith; <hi>And to another, is giuen faith by the Å¿ame Å¿pirit.</hi> As alÅ¿o, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. <hi>For, vnto you it is giuen for ChriÅ¿t, that not onely yee Å¿hould belieue in him, but alÅ¿o Å¿uffer for his Å¿ake.</hi> So faith is the gift of the holie Spirit: and this gift is not giuen to all men and women, as the ApoÅ¿tle plainly declareth; <hi>All haue not faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gift, though it be giuen, it is not giuen to all, but is onely giuen to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: that is, to Å¿o many as the Lord hath appointed to life euerlaÅ¿ting. This gift, where-euer it is, and in what hart Å¿oeuer it be, it is neuer idle, but perpetuallie working; and working well, by loue, and charitie, as the ApoÅ¿tle affirmeth, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 5.6. This gift, vvhere-euer it is, is not dead, but quick, and liuely, as the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Iames</hi> teÅ¿tifieth, in his Å¿econd chapter.</p>
            <p>And, to let you knowe whether it be liuely, and working, or not, there is no
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20181:138"/>better meanes, then to looke vnto the fruites, and effects that flowe from it. And therefore, that yee, by your owne effects, may be the more aÅ¿Å¿ured of the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of your faith, I will giue you three Å¿peciall effects to obÅ¿erue, by the which yee may iudge of the goodneÅ¿s of your faith.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, looke to thy hart,
<note place="margin">Certaine effects, whereby we may know if wee haue faith.</note> and caÅ¿t thine eye on it: If thou haÅ¿t a deÅ¿ire to pray, a deÅ¿ire to craue mercy for thy Å¿innes, to call vpon Gods holy Name for mercy and grace: if there be Å¿uch a thing in thy hart, as a deÅ¿ire to pray, if thy hart be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and hath a thirÅ¿t to Å¿eeke after mercie, and grace; though the greateÅ¿t part of thine hart repine, &amp; would drawe thee from prayer, yet aÅ¿Å¿uredly, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire, that thou haÅ¿t in any meaÅ¿ure to praier, is the true effect of the right faith. If thou haue a hart to pray to GOD, though this deÅ¿ire be but Å¿lender, aÅ¿Å¿ure thy Å¿elfe, thy Å¿oule hath life: for prayer is the life of the Å¿oule, and maketh thy faith liuelie. And why? Prayer is Gods ovvne gift; it is no gift of ours; for if it vvere ours, it vvould bee euill:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:139"/>but it is the beÅ¿t gift, that euer God gaue man; and Å¿o it muÅ¿t bee the gift of his owne holy Spirit; and beeing his owne gift, it muÅ¿t make our faith liuely. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, thou art not able, nor thou da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t not call vpon him, in whom thou belieueÅ¿t not, as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. For if I intreat him by prayer, I muÅ¿t truÅ¿t in him. Then prayer is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine argument of iuÅ¿tifying faith, and beliefe in GOD: for I cannot Å¿peake to him, much leÅ¿Å¿e pray to him, in whom I truÅ¿t not. And though the hart be not fully reÅ¿olued, and well diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, yet if there be any part of the heart that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to prayer, it is a Å¿ure gage, that that part belieueth.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd effect, wherby thou Å¿halt knowe, whether faith be in thee, or not, is this: ObÅ¿erue, &amp; aduiÅ¿e with thy Å¿elfe, if thy hart can be content to renounce thy rancour, to forgiue thy grudges, and that freely, for Gods cauÅ¿e. CanÅ¿t thou doe this? And vvilt thou forgiue thy neighbour, as freely as God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen thee? AÅ¿Å¿uredly, this is an effect of the right Å¿pirit; for Nature could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20181:139"/>giue that. There is nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto Nature bendeth it Å¿elfe more, then to rancour, and enuy; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherein Nature placeth her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour more greedily, then in priuy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</p>
            <p>Now, if thy heart bee Å¿o tamed and brought downe, that it will vvillinglie forgiue the iniurie, for Gods cauÅ¿e, this is the effect of the right Å¿pirit. This is not my Å¿aying, it is the Å¿aying of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, in the EuangeliÅ¿t <hi>Math.</hi> 6.14. where hee thus Å¿peaketh; <hi>If yee doe forgiue men their treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es, your heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father vvill alÅ¿o forgiue you.</hi> And in the fifteenth verÅ¿e, <hi>But if yee doe not forgiue men, their treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es, no more will your heauenly Father forgiue you your treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, Hee that forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wrongs, Å¿hall haue wrongs forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him: but hee that will reuenge his wrongs, wrong Å¿hall be reuenged vpon him. Therefore, as thou wouldeÅ¿t bee Å¿pared of thy wrongs done vnto the mightie GOD, Å¿pare thou thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. I will not inÅ¿iÅ¿t; examine vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:20181:140"/>yee haue faith, or not; examine it by prayer, examine it by the diÅ¿charge of your owne priuie grudges: for, if yee want theÅ¿e effects, a hart full of rancor, a hart voide of prayer, is a hart faithleÅ¿s, and meet for hell.</p>
            <p>The third effect of faith, is compaÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thou muÅ¿t bow thy hart, &amp; extend thy pitty, vnto the poore members of ChriÅ¿t his body, and Å¿uffer them not to want, if thou haue: for, except yee haue this compaÅ¿sion, yee haue no faith.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20181:140"/>increaÅ¿e our faith: I belieue, Lord help my vnbeliefe.</hi> Then by ChriÅ¿t his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, we plainly Å¿ee, that this faith needeth continually to be nouriÅ¿hed, &amp; helped; and it cannot be helped, but by prayer: therefore Å¿hould we alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in prayer. That this faith Å¿hould be helped; and that we Å¿hould be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually vpon our guarde, in feare &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, to get it augmented, the terrible doubtings, the wonderfull pits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿peration, into the vvhich the deareÅ¿t Å¿eruants of GOD are caÅ¿t, doe dailie teach. For the beÅ¿t Å¿eruaunts of GOD, are exerciÅ¿ed with terrible doubtings in their Å¿oules, with wonderfull Å¿tamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and they Å¿hal be brought at Å¿ome times, as appeares in their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the very brinke of deÅ¿pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. TheÅ¿e doubtings, &amp; Å¿tammerings, lets vs Å¿ee, that this faith of ours, would be perpetually nouriÅ¿hed; and that wee haue need continually to pray for the increaÅ¿e of it. It pleaÅ¿eth the Lord at Å¿om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to let his Å¿eruaunts haue a Å¿ight of them-Å¿elues, to caÅ¿t them dovvne, and to let them Å¿ee how vgly Å¿inne is:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:141"/>It pleaÅ¿eth him to let them fall, into the bitterneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿inne; And to what end? Not that hee will deuoure them, and Å¿uffer them to be Å¿wallowed vp of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cryeth out, That like an hungry Lyon, the Lord is like to deuoure him, and bruiÅ¿e him in pce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet the Lord Å¿uffers him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿paire. And though <hi>Dauid</hi> cry, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with this conÅ¿uming fire; I cannot endure the fire of the Lords IelouÅ¿ie; yet hee deÅ¿paireth not. But the Lord caÅ¿teth his Å¿eruants very lowe. To what end? To the end that they may feele in their harts, &amp; conÅ¿ciences, what ChriÅ¿t Å¿uffered for them on the CroÅ¿Å¿e, in Å¿oule and body. Yea, we would think, that there had been plaine colluÅ¿ion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father, and the Sonne, &amp; that his Å¿ufferings had been no Å¿uffering, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we felt in our Å¿oules, in Å¿ome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure, the hell vvhich hee Å¿uÅ¿tained in full meaÅ¿ure.</p>
            <p>So, to the end that wee might cleerly vnderÅ¿tand the bitterneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿inne, that vvee might knovve how farre wee are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20181:141"/>indebted to ChriÅ¿t, who Å¿uffered Å¿uch torments for our Å¿innes, and that vvee may be the more able to thank him, and to praiÅ¿e his holie Name, hee Å¿uffers his owne Å¿eruants to doubt, but not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿paire; hee forgiues their doubtings, he forgiues their Å¿tammerings, and in his owne time, hee Å¿upports them, &amp; brings vs vnto the waters of life.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e doubtings,
<note place="margin">Doubting and faith may lodge in one Å¿oule.</note> as I haue often Å¿aid, may lodge in one Å¿oule, with faith; for doubting, and faith, are not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie oppoÅ¿ite: onely faith, and deÅ¿payre are oppoÅ¿ite; and therefore, faith, and deÅ¿paire, cannot both lodge in one Å¿oule. For, deÅ¿paire ouerthroweth the pillars of hope; and where there is no hope, there can be no faith. But as for doubting, it may lodge, it vvill lodge, and hath lodged, in the Å¿oules of the beÅ¿t Å¿eruaunts that euer God had. Mark the Å¿peech of the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>Wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in doubt,</hi> Å¿aith hee, <hi>but wee deÅ¿paire not.</hi> So doubting, and faith, may lodge in one Å¿oule.</p>
            <p>And from whence floweth this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? VVee knowe, that in the regenerate
<pb facs="tcp:20181:142"/>man, there is a remnant, corruption: for we haue not our heauen in this earth; though wee beginne our heauen heere, yet we get it not fully heere. And if all corruption vvere avvay, vvhat Å¿hould there vvant of a full heauen heere? So, it is onely begunne in this life, and not perfected: therefore, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in the Å¿oule, a great corruption, which is neuer idle, but continually oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied.</p>
            <p>This corruption, is euer bringing foorth the birth of finne, more, or leÅ¿Å¿e; euery Å¿inne hurts the conÅ¿cience: a hurt conÅ¿cience impaireth the perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, and Å¿o comes in the doubting. For, there is not a Å¿inne that we commit, but it baniÅ¿heth light, and caÅ¿teth a myÅ¿t ouer the eye of our faith, whereby wee doubt, and Å¿tagger in our Å¿ight: and were it not, that the Lord in his mercy taketh vs vp, giueth vs the gift of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and maketh vs euery day, as oft as wee Å¿inne, to cry as oft for mercy, and Å¿o to repaire the loÅ¿Å¿e that wee haue of faith, to repayre the loÅ¿Å¿e that vvee haue of the feeling of mercie, we would
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20181:142"/>wholly put out that Å¿ame light. But it pleaÅ¿eth the Lord, though wee be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day Å¿inning, to giue vs the gift of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and by repentance, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire our faith; to repaire the Å¿enÅ¿e, and feeling of mercie in vs, and to put vs in that Å¿ame Å¿tate of perÅ¿waÅ¿ion wherein wee were before. Therefore, if GOD beginne not, continue not, and end not with mercie, in that very moment that hee abÅ¿tracts his mercy from vs, wee will decay. So wee muÅ¿t be diligent, in calling for mercy; wee muÅ¿t be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant continually, in Å¿eeking to haue a feeling of mercie. Thus much for the doubting.</p>
            <p>Novv, howÅ¿oeuer it be Å¿ure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<note place="margin">A doubting and weake faith, is faith, &amp; Å¿hal neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</note> that the faith of the beÅ¿t children of GOD, is often Å¿ubiect to doubting; yet it is as Å¿ure and certaine, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wholly extinct: albeit it were neuer Å¿o vveake, yet it Å¿hall neuer vtterlie decay, and periÅ¿h out of the hart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it once maketh reÅ¿idence. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort &amp; conÅ¿olation, the Spirit of God hath Å¿ette downe in his vvord, to Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the troubled hart; That hovvÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="tcp:20181:143"/>faith be weake, yet a weake faith is faith: and where that faith is, there will euer be mercie.</p>
            <p>Yee haue in <hi>Romans</hi> 11.29. that <hi>The gifts, and calling of GOD, are vvithout repentance.</hi> But among all his gifts, that are of this Å¿ort, faith is one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t: therefore it cannot be reuoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>Yee haue in <hi>Iude</hi> 3. <hi>That faith vvas once giuen vnto the Saints.</hi> Once giuen, that is, conÅ¿tantly giuen, neuer to be changed, nor vtterly taken from them. The Lord will not repent him of this gift: but the Å¿oule which he hath loued once, he will loue perpetually.</p>
            <p>It is true and certaine, that the Å¿par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of faith, which are kindled in the hart, by the Spirit of GOD, may be obÅ¿cured &amp; Å¿mothered for a long time; they may be couered with the aÅ¿hes of our owne corruption, and with our own ill deedes, and wickednes, into which we daily fall. It is true, that the effects of a liuely faith will be interrupted, and that thy luÅ¿ts and affections will preuaile for a long time: Å¿o that when thou lookeÅ¿t
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20181:143"/>on thy Å¿elfe, vpon the Iudgements of God, that hang ouer thy Å¿oule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and when thou lookeÅ¿t vpon thy diÅ¿Å¿olute life, and on the anger of God, againÅ¿t this diÅ¿Å¿olute life: In the minde, in the hart, and conÅ¿cience of him, that hath Å¿o Å¿mothered, and oppreÅ¿Å¿ed his faith, it will oft times come to paÅ¿Å¿e, in his owne iudgement, hauing his eyes fixed on himÅ¿elfe onely, that hee vvill thinke himÅ¿elfe to be a reprobate, to be an out-caÅ¿t, and neuer able to recouer mercy.</p>
            <p>Where this corruption burÅ¿teth forth in this groÅ¿Å¿e maner, after that the Lord hath called thee; looke how Å¿oone the Lord beginneth to vvaken thee againe, incontinent, thou fixeÅ¿t thine eyes vpon thine owne life, and entreÅ¿t into a deepe conÅ¿ideration, as well of the weight of thy Å¿inne, as of the weight of the wrath of GOD, which thou Å¿eeÅ¿t following thereupon, and art loath to remit theÅ¿e cogitations, to thinke vpon the deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of the mercie of God.</p>
            <p>ReÅ¿ting on theÅ¿e conÅ¿iderations, it cannot but come to paÅ¿Å¿e, that in thine
<pb facs="tcp:20181:144"/>owne iudgement, thou art an out-caÅ¿t. And yet GOD forbidde it were Å¿o; for though theÅ¿e Å¿parks of the Spirit, be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the corruption that is vvithin thy Å¿oule, yet theÅ¿e Å¿parkles are not wholly put out.</p>
            <p>And to let you Å¿ee that they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiÅ¿hed,
<note place="margin">The Å¿par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of faith though they be Å¿mothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they are not wholly put out, nor are idle.</note> though they break not forth in the outward effects, that the world may knowe thee to be a faithfull man, as heeretofore; yet theÅ¿e Å¿parkles are not idle, and thou Å¿hall finde them not to be idle in thee. As for confirmation of my Argument, that howÅ¿oeuer our bodies are let looÅ¿e to all diÅ¿Å¿olution, after our effectuall calling within vs in our Å¿oules: that yet the Å¿parkles are not idle; ye Å¿ee, that though the fire be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the aÅ¿hes, yet it is a fire: there is no man will Å¿ay, that the fire is put out, though it be couered. No more is faith put out of the Å¿oule, though it be Å¿o couered, that it neither giue heat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or light outwardly.</p>
            <p>An example of this, we haue cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> after his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, in that PÅ¿alme of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20181:144"/>
               <hi>PÅ¿alme</hi> 51.11. hee prayeth to GOD in theÅ¿e words, <hi>CaÅ¿t me not away from thy preÅ¿ence.</hi> And what addeth he? <hi>And take not thy holy Spirit from mee.</hi> Had he not loÅ¿t the Spirit, by his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and murther? No: for he would not haue Å¿aid then, <hi>Take it not from mee:</hi> But, <hi>ReÅ¿tore it to mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that he vÅ¿eth the like in the verÅ¿e following, <hi>ReÅ¿tore mee to the ioy of thy Å¿aluation.</hi> Not that hee wanted the Å¿pirit wholly; but that the Å¿pirit lacked force in him, and needed Å¿trengthening and fortification: it would be Å¿tirred vp, that the flame of it might appear. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I Å¿ay, in that <hi>Dauid</hi> Å¿peaketh Å¿o plainely, after his adultery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Take not that Spirit from mee;</hi> it is a certaine argument, that the faithfull haue neuer the Å¿pirit of God alwaies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, in their greateÅ¿t diÅ¿Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. The Å¿econd point is this: How proue I that theÅ¿e Å¿parkles are not idle, though the outward effects be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? As <hi>Dauid</hi> felt this in his conÅ¿cience, Å¿o euery one of you, may feele it in your owne conÅ¿ciences.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:145"/>
            <p>The Spirit of God, in mans hart, can not be idle; but theÅ¿e Å¿parkles, during the time that the body is let looÅ¿e to all diÅ¿Å¿olutions, theÅ¿e Å¿parkles are accuÅ¿ing thy diÅ¿Å¿olution, are finding fault vvith thy manners: theÅ¿e Å¿parkles, Å¿uffer thee not to take the pleaÅ¿ure of thy bodie, without great bitterneÅ¿Å¿e, and continuall remorÅ¿e. And theÅ¿e Å¿parkles, where they are, will make the Å¿oule vvherein they dwell, to vtter theÅ¿e Å¿peeches at one time or other, once in the twenty-foure houres; <hi>Alas, I am dooing the euill, vvhich I vvould not doe,</hi> if I had power or Å¿trength to reÅ¿iÅ¿t my affection: and if I might be maiÅ¿ter of my affections, I would not for all the world, doe the euill which I doe. Againe, if I had power, to doe the good vvhich I vvould doe, I vvould not leaue it vndone for all the vvorld.</p>
            <p>So, theÅ¿e Å¿parkles, though they haue not Å¿uch force and Å¿trength preÅ¿entlie, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the affection, and abÅ¿taine from dooing euill deedes, yet perpetually in the hart, they are finding fault with thy corruption, and Å¿uffer thee not to take
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20181:145"/>thy pleaÅ¿ure without paine: but laÅ¿t of all, force thee to vtter theÅ¿e Å¿peeches; <hi>If I had Å¿trength to reÅ¿iÅ¿t, I vvould not doe the euill vvhich I doe.</hi> Where theÅ¿e Å¿peeches are, no queÅ¿tion they are the words of a Å¿oule vvhich the Lord hath begunne to Å¿anctifie: and beeing once Å¿anctified, in deÅ¿pight of the diuell, and of the corruption that is in vs, this faith Å¿hall neuer periÅ¿h: but if the whole Å¿oule, without contradiction, vvith a greedie appetite and pleaÅ¿ure, be carried to euill, and hath no Å¿orrow for it, that Å¿oule is in an ill eÅ¿tate; I can looke for nothing in Å¿uch a Å¿oule, but death, except the Lord of his great mercy preuent it.</p>
            <p>But where this remorÅ¿e, and Å¿orrow, and Å¿uch Å¿peeches are in the Å¿oule; that Å¿oule, in the time that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Å¿hall recouer Å¿trength. The Lord Å¿hall neuer Å¿uffer thoÅ¿e Å¿parkles to bee vvholly taken away; but in his own time he Å¿hall fortifie them, and make them to breake out before the world, in good works. The Lord, in his owne time, will Å¿anctifie them, hee will Å¿catter the aÅ¿hes of corruption, Å¿tirre vp the Å¿parkles, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20181:146"/>make them to breake out into a better life then euer they did before; as ye may cleerely Å¿ee, that <hi>Dauids</hi> repentance hath done more good to the Church of God, then if hee had neuer fallen. Thus far concerning the effects.</p>
            <p>Though the effects of repentance bee interrupted,
<note place="margin">Similitudes, Å¿hewing that the Å¿parkles of faith, thogh they be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, are not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hed.</note> yet thoÅ¿e Å¿parkles are not extinguiÅ¿hed. For, there is no man will thinke, that the fire, vvhich is couered with aÅ¿hes, is extinguiÅ¿hed; but beeing Å¿tirred vp in the morning, it will burne as cleerely, as it did the night before. There is no man wil think, the trees, that now in the time of Winter want leaues, fruit, and externall beauty, to be dead. There is no man will thinke, the Sunne to be out of the firmament, though it be ouerÅ¿hadowed with a clowd of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and miÅ¿t. There is great difference between a Å¿leeping diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, and death: for men are not dead, though they be Å¿lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; and yet there is nothing liker vnto death, then Å¿leep. As there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a drunken man, and a dead man; Å¿o there is great odds, betwixt the faith that lieth hid for awhile, &amp; vttereth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20181:146"/>not it Å¿elfe, and the light that is vtterly put out.</p>
            <p>When we breake not forth into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard deedes, GOD forbid that vvee Å¿hold think, that theÅ¿e Å¿parkles are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiÅ¿hed. Indeed, the Å¿oule which is viÅ¿ited, after foule and heinous back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿lidings from his calling, and againÅ¿t his knowledge, before this foule recouer the former beautie, it is in a Å¿trange danger. For if the Lord Å¿uffer thy corruption to get looÅ¿e, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that it cary thee, as it will, and by all meanes poÅ¿sible, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thee to labour, to put out the Å¿par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of regeneration; vvhen the Lord beginnes to challenge thee, or to make thee render an account of this life paÅ¿t, the Å¿oule of that man, when it is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, is in great danger.</p>
            <p>So that, no queÅ¿tion, when the Lord beginnes to lay to your charge, your diÅ¿Å¿olute life, the contempt and abuÅ¿e of your calling: aÅ¿Å¿uredly, your Å¿oules are Å¿o neere to the brinke of deÅ¿peration, that there can be nothing neerer. For, vvilt thou looke to GOD? thou vvilt Å¿ee nothing, but his anger kindled,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:147"/>as a fire againÅ¿t thee: wilt thou looke to thy Å¿elfe, thou wilt Å¿ee nothing but Å¿inne prouoking his anger: thou wilt Å¿ee the contempt, and abuÅ¿e of thy calling, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his anger; thou wilt Å¿ee nothing but matter of deÅ¿paire.</p>
            <p>And what is the beÅ¿t pillar, and Å¿ureÅ¿t retreat, whereupon Å¿uch a Å¿oule, that is Å¿o neere to the brinke of deÅ¿peration, may repoÅ¿e?
<note place="margin">A Å¿ure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e on in higheÅ¿t ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> I will Å¿hew you the helpe whereupon. When thou art aÅ¿Å¿aulted, by all the greateÅ¿t tentations thou canÅ¿t imagine; when there is nothing before thee but death; when thou Å¿eeÅ¿t the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill accuÅ¿ing thee, thine own conÅ¿cience bearing him witnes againÅ¿t thee, thy life accuÅ¿ing thee, and the abuÅ¿e of thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling accuÅ¿ing thee: whither Å¿halt thou goe? Looke back againe to thy forepaÅ¿t experience, caÅ¿t ouer thy memorie, and remember, if God at any time, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meaÅ¿ure, hath loued thee; if euer thou haÅ¿t felt the loue and fauour of GOD in thy hart and conÅ¿cience. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member if euer the Lord hath Å¿o diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed thy hart, that as hee loued thee, thou louedÅ¿t him, &amp; hadÅ¿t a deÅ¿ire to obtaine
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20181:147"/>him. Remember this, and repoÅ¿e thine aÅ¿Å¿urance on this, that as hee loued thee once, he will loue thee euer, and will aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uredly reÅ¿tore thee to that loue, before thou departeÅ¿t this life. The hart that felt once this loue of God, Å¿hall feele it againe: and looke vvhat gift, or grace, or what taÅ¿te of the power of the world to come, that euer the Lord gaue to his creatures in this life, to that Å¿ame degree of mercy, hee Å¿hall reÅ¿tore his creature, before it depart this life.</p>
            <p>So the Å¿oule that is toÅ¿Å¿ed with high aÅ¿Å¿aults, and great dangers; where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent things will not helpe, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that it haue recourÅ¿e vnto things paÅ¿t, and keepe in memory the afore-paÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of mercy, which the Lord hath freely Å¿hewed towards that Å¿oule. This Å¿ame memory Å¿hall be Å¿o pleaÅ¿ant to the Å¿oule, that it Å¿hall Å¿tay it preÅ¿ently from deÅ¿peration, and vphold it vnto the time the Lord pacifie that hart, &amp; giue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to that Å¿oule: which beeing done, that Å¿oule Å¿hall Å¿ee, that hovv-Å¿oeuer GOD was angry, hee was angry one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for awhile.</p>

            <p>I Å¿peake theÅ¿e things, not that I think that euery one of you hath taÅ¿ted of them; and yet in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, the Å¿eruaunts of GOD muÅ¿t taÅ¿te of them: and yee that haue not taÅ¿ted of them, may taÅ¿te of them before yee die.

And Å¿eeing that religion was inÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of God, to Å¿erue as a path-way, to conuey vs to our chiefe felicity: and happy we cannot be, except wee be like vnto our GOD; like vnto him we can not be, except we haue loue (For, as it is 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.8. <hi>GOD is loue.</hi>) So, Å¿eeing God is loue it Å¿elfe, who-Å¿oeuer will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emble him, muÅ¿t be indued vvith the oyle of loue. This onely one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, teÅ¿tifieth to vs, that this loue is a principall head, vvhereunto, all things that are commaunded in religion, ought to be referred.</p>
            <p>To Å¿pend long time in the praiÅ¿e of loue, I hold it not neceÅ¿Å¿arie, Å¿eeing the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:149"/>holy Scripture reÅ¿ounds, in blaÅ¿ing the commendations of it: but that we Å¿peak not of any thing ambiguous, I will let you Å¿ee, how this word is conÅ¿idered, &amp; taken in the Scriptures.
<note place="margin">How the word loue is taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Loue is conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either as a Å¿pring or fountaine, from whence the reÅ¿t proceedes; that is, for the loue, whereby we loue God. And as loue commeth firÅ¿t from God, and is poured by his holy Spirit into our harts: So it firÅ¿t redownds vpward, and Å¿trikes backe vpon himÅ¿elfe: for the loue of GOD, muÅ¿t euer goe before the loue of the creature.</p>
            <p>Next, we take this word, for that loue whereby wee loue Gods creatures, our neighbours; and eÅ¿pecially them that are of the family of faith. And thirdly, It is taken for the deeds of the Å¿econd Table, which flowe from this loue.</p>
            <p>Now, when I Å¿peake of loue, I Å¿peake of it, as in the Å¿econd Å¿ignification; to wit, as it is taken for the loue of our neighbour.
<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of loue.</note> And taking it Å¿o, I call loue <hi>The gift of God,</hi> poured into the harts of men and women: by the which gift, we firÅ¿t loue God, in ChriÅ¿t our Sauiour;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20181:149"/>and next, in God, &amp; for Gods cauÅ¿e, we loue all his creatures, but chiefly our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, that are of the family of faith, the children of one common father with vs. Wee will examine this definition; I Å¿ay,
<note place="margin">Of our loue toward God.</note> firÅ¿t the loue of God, as it commeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> GOD, it returneth to God; as it comes downe from him, Å¿o it Å¿trikes vpward to him againe. And is it not good reaÅ¿on? And why? Let thy hart fix thy loue as long as thou wilt vpon the creatures, thou Å¿halt neuer be Å¿atiate, nor thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection Å¿hall neuer be content, except thou lay hold on God: but if once thou loue God in thy hart, and caÅ¿t thy affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon him, &amp; once takeÅ¿t hold on him, the longer thou loueÅ¿t him, the greater Å¿atietie and contentment Å¿halt thou haue; thou Å¿halt not thirÅ¿t for any other. For, as to the creatures, there is neuer a creature that God hath created, but it is Å¿tamped with his owne Å¿tamp, &amp; euery creature beareth his Image: and looking to the Image of God in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Å¿hould it not draw thee to him, that thou fix not thy hart vpon the creature? for his owne Image, in his creature,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:150"/>Å¿hould lead thee to himÅ¿elfe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the more that thou knoweÅ¿t the creatures, and the greater varietie of knowledge that thou haÅ¿t of them, the more Å¿hold euery particular knowledge of them, draw thee to God: &amp; the more Å¿houldeÅ¿t thou wonder at thy God, and knowe thy duty towards him. And, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that delight flovveth from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; euery knowledge hath his owne delight; as the variety of knowledge, that ariÅ¿eth from the creatures, Å¿hould make the minde to mount vp, to the knowledge of God: Å¿o the variety of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that ariÅ¿e vpon the diuerÅ¿itie of this knowledge, Å¿hould moue the hart vpward, to the loue of God: and the hart getting hold of God, and beeing Å¿eiÅ¿ed with the loue of God, and the minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occupied with the true knowledge of God; Å¿o Å¿oone as hart and mind is full of God, the hart is quiet, and the minde is Å¿atisfied. So that, the more this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge groweth in thy minde, the greater contentment thou haÅ¿t; and the more the loue of God groweth in thy hart, the greater ioy &amp; reioycing haÅ¿t thou in thy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20181:150"/>Å¿oule. And why? In God ye haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the creatures, but ye haue himÅ¿elfe, beÅ¿ides the creatures: and therefore, in God, ye haue all the knowledge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that can ariÅ¿e of the creatures; and beÅ¿ide the creatures, yee haue God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe, vvho is the Creator. And Å¿o I Å¿ay, The mind of man, can neuer quiet it Å¿elfe in the knowledge, nor the hart can neuer Å¿ettle it Å¿elfe in the loue of naked crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; in reÅ¿pect they are flowing, &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as <hi>Salomon</hi> calls them: But in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God, rightly known, and earneÅ¿tly loued, the mind Å¿hal finde a ful reÅ¿t, and the hart Å¿hall haue a perfect ioy. For our affection is Å¿o inÅ¿atiable, that no finite thing thing will Å¿atisfie it; nor there can be no Å¿olide Å¿ettling vpon the thing that is tranÅ¿itory. So, the loue ought to mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t vpward, firÅ¿t to God; in whoÅ¿e face, the hart Å¿hal find full and perfect ioy.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd Argument that I vÅ¿e, is this; Seeing there is onely one precept left by our MaÅ¿ter, in recommendation to be obÅ¿erued by vs; namely,
<note place="margin">Of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour.</note> That eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of vs Å¿hould loue another: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our wiÅ¿e MaÅ¿ter, vnderÅ¿tanding wel, that where loue vvas, there needed no
<pb facs="tcp:20181:151"/>more lawes: that the life of man, by loue onely, behooued to be moÅ¿t happy; left onely the Å¿ame, in chiefe recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and takes vp the whole Law &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pel, in one word, <hi>Loue.</hi> And if the hart of man were indued with loue, his life might be moÅ¿t happy, and bleÅ¿Å¿ed: for, there is nothing maketh this life happy, but the reÅ¿emblance, and likelihood that we haue with God. The neerer we drawe to God, the more bleÅ¿Å¿ed is our life; for there cannot be Å¿o happy a life, as the life of God. In the firÅ¿t EpiÅ¿t. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 4.8. <hi>God is loue:</hi> therefore, the more we are in loue, the more neer we are to that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py life: for we are in God, &amp; partakers of the life of God. When I Å¿peake this, yee muÅ¿t not thinke, that loue in God, and loue in vs, is one thing: for, loue is but a quality in vs, and it is not a quality in God. There is nothing in God, but that which is God; Å¿o loue in God, is his owne eÅ¿Å¿ence: therfore, the more that ye grow in loue, the neerer ye draw to God, &amp; to that happy, &amp; bleÅ¿Å¿ed life. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more profitable, more agreeable, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>uenient vnto nature, then to loue; and aboue all things, to loue God. And
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20181:151"/>therefore it is, that God, &amp; his Angels, are moÅ¿t happy &amp; bleÅ¿Å¿ed, becauÅ¿e they loue all things, &amp; deÅ¿ire euer to do good. On the other Å¿ide, there is nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, nothing more noyÅ¿ome, more hurtfull, and that eates vp nature more, then to burn with enuy and hatred: and therfore it is that the diuells are moÅ¿t mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erable, who torment themÅ¿elues vvith continuall malice and hatred; burning with a vehement appetite, to be noyÅ¿om to all creatures. So, as the life of the diuel is moÅ¿t vnhappy, becauÅ¿e he is full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy &amp; malice; Å¿o our life wil be moÅ¿t hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if we be full of loue. I will no further Å¿peake of loue: Onely, if yee haue loue, mark the effects of it, Å¿et down, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.5.6.7. verÅ¿es, which effects, if ye haue not in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, yee haue not true loue.</p>
            <p>I end heer.
<note place="margin">ConcluÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</note> Ye Å¿ee in what points eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you ought to be prepared: Yee muÅ¿t be indued with this loue; &amp; ye muÅ¿t be indued with faith; &amp; if ye haue theÅ¿e, in any Å¿mall meaÅ¿ure, goe boldly to the hearing of the vvord, &amp; to the receiuing of the Sacraments. This is the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we allow of. I grant, the PapiÅ¿ts
<pb facs="tcp:20181:152"/>haue a preparation, farre differing from this, and therfore they can haue no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the word of God. LaÅ¿t of all, Å¿eeing that we are commanded to try our Å¿elues; He that lacketh knowledge, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not try himÅ¿elfe; A mad man cannot try himÅ¿elfe; A child cannot try himÅ¿elfe; therfore they ought not to come to the Lords Table. All theÅ¿e things being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered aright, he that hath faith, &amp; loue, in any kinde of meaÅ¿ure, let him come to the Table of the Lord: And all theÅ¿e things Å¿erue, as wel for the hearing of the vvord fruitfully, as for the receiuing of the Sacrament. Therefore, the Lord of his mercy illuminate your mindes, and work Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure of faith, and loue in your harts, that yee may be partakers of that heauenly life, offered in the vvord, and Sacraments; that yee may beginne your heauen heere, and obtaine the full fruition of the life to come: and that in the righteous merits of ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us. To whom, with the Father, and the holie GhoÅ¿t, be all honour, praiÅ¿e, and glory, both now, and for euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>
