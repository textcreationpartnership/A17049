            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing in this world, nor out of this world, more to be wiſhed of euery one of you, more to be craued, and ſought, of euery one of you, then to bee conioyned with Chriſt Ieſus, then once to be made one, with the God of glory, Chriſt Ieſus. This heauenly, and celeſtiall coniunction, is purchaſed and brought about, by two ſpeciall meanes; It is brought about, by meanes of the word and preaching of the Goſpell: and it is brought about, by the meanes of the Sacraments, and miniſtration thereof.
<pb facs="tcp:20181:4"/>The word leadeth vs to Chriſt, by the eare; the Sacraments, lead vs to Chriſt, by the eye: Two ſenſes, of all the reſt, which God hath choſen, as moſt meet for this purpoſe, to inſtruct vs, and bring vs vnto Chriſt. For that doctrine muſt be moſt effectuall, &amp; mouing, that wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and ſtirreth vp moſt of the outward ſenſes: that doctrine, that wakeneth not onely the eare, but the eye, the taſte, the feeling, and all the reſt of the outward ſenſes, muſt moue the heart moſt, muſt be moſt effectuall, and pearcing in the ſoule. But ſo it is, that this doctrine of the Sacraments, moues, ſtirres vp, and wakens moſt of the outward ſenſes, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt bee (if wee come well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto it) moſt effectuall to ſtirre vp the inward ſenſes of the dull heart. But there is a thing, that yee muſt euer remember; there is no doctrine, neither of the ſimple word, nor yet of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, if Chriſt abſtract his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is able to moue: therefore, when euer yee come to heare the doctrine, whether it be of the Sacraments, or of the ſimple word, craue of God, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20181:4"/>hee would be preſent by his holy ſpirit, or otherwiſe all the doctrine in the earth will not awaile you. Alwaies, this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Sacraments, ſtirres vp, and wakens moſt of the outward ſenſes, and therefore there is no queſtion, but it is an effectuall, and potent inſtrument, to waken, prepare, and ſtirre vp our hearts.</p>
            <p>Then to let you ſee what the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament meaneth:
<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> and to remoue the ambiguitie of it, it is certaine, and out of all queſtion, that the Latine Diuines, who were moſt ancient, did interpret the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by the word Sacrament; and they vſed the Greeke word, not onely to ſignifie the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Supper of the Lord, and the whole action of Baptiſme: but they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the word Myſtery, to ſignifie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is darke, and bid in it ſelfe, and not frequented in the common vſe of men: as after this manner, the Apoſtle calleth the vocation of the Gentiles a myſterie.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ</hi> 3.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.32.</note> This coniunction which is begun heere betwixt vs and Chriſt, is called a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and the Latine Interpreters, call it a
<pb facs="tcp:20181:5"/>Sacrament: and to be ſhort, ye will not finde in the booke of God a word more frequent, then the word Myſterie. But as for the word Sacrament, wherby they interpret the Greeke word, we finde not this word by the ſame Diuines to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo largely; neither is it take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in any part of the booke of God. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the word Sacrament, is very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous in it ſelfe, and there ariſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ambiguitie of this word many controuerſies, which are not yet ceaſed, nor will not ceaſe while the world la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth: whereas if they had kept the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words, and called them as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calleth them, Signes, and Seales; all this digladiation, ſtrife and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appearingly had not fallen out: but where men will be wiſer then God, and giue names to things without warrant from God, vpon the wit of man, which is but meere folly, all this ſtirre falleth out. Well then, to come vnto the purpoſe; The ancient Diuines tooke the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as we may perceiue, in a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner: Sometime they tooke it for the whole action; that is, the whole
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20181:5"/>miniſtery of the Elements: ſometime, they tooke it not for the whole action, but for the outward things, that are vſed in the action of Baptiſme, and of the Supper, as they tooke it, for the vvater, and ſprinkling of it; for the Bread and Wine breaking, diſtributing, and eating thereof. Thirdly againe, they tooke it not for the whole outward things, that are vſed in the action, but onely for the materiall, and earthly things, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: as, for Bread and Wine in the Supper, and water in Baptiſme. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked eate the body of our Lord, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacrament onely, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Elements onely. Laſt of all they tooke it not only for the Elements, but for the things ſignified by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And after this manner, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, that a Sacrament ſtandeth of two things: the one, earthly; the other, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly. The ancient Diuines then, taking the word after theſe ſorts, no queſtion, all theſe waies they tooke it rightly.</p>
            <p>But leauing the ambiguitie of the word, I take the word Sacrament, as it is
<pb facs="tcp:20181:6"/>taken, and vſed this day in the Church of GOD, for a holy Signe and Seale that is annexed to the preached word of God, to ſeale vp and confirme the truth contained in the ſame vvord: ſo that I call not the ſeale, ſeparated from the vvord a Sacrament. For, as there can not bee a ſeale, but that which is the ſeale of an euidence, and if the ſeale be ſeparated from the euidence, it is not a ſeale, but looke what it is by nature, it is no more: So there cannot bee a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, except it bee annexed to the euidence of the vvord; but looke what the Sacrament was by nature, it is no more. Was it a common peece of bread? it remaines common bread, except it be ioyned to the euidence of the vvord. Therefore the vvord onelie cannot be a Sacrament, nor the element onely, cannot be a Sacrament; but the vvord and element coniunctly, muſt make a Sacrament. And ſo <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaid well, Let the vvord come to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo yee ſhall haue a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So then, the vvord muſt come to the element: that is, the vvord prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20181:6"/>diſtinctly, and all the parts of it opened vp, muſt goe before the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to of the ſacrament; and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a ſeale muſt follow, and ſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued accordingly.</p>
            <p>Then I call a Sacrament, the vvord and ſeale coniunctly, the one hung to the other. It is without all controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and there is no doubt in it, that all Sacraments are ſignes: Now if a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be a ſigne, as the ſigne is in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that <hi>Category,</hi> for ſo wee muſt ſpeake it: ſo the Sacrament muſt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that ſame <hi>Category</hi> of relation. Now euery relation againe muſt ſtand of force betwixt two things; for one thing cannot bee the correlatiue of it ſelfe: but in a lawfull relation, of force there muſt be two things, which two, haue euer a mutuall reſpect the one to the other: therfore, in euery Sacrament that hath a relation, there muſt be two things, which two haue euer a mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the one to the other.</p>
            <p>Take away one of theſe two things from the Sacrament, ye loſe the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; &amp; loſing the relation, ye loſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
<pb facs="tcp:20181:7"/>Confound any of theſe two with the other, make either a confuſion or permixtion of them, ye loſe the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and loſing the relation, ye loſe the Sacrament. Turne ouer the one into the other, ſo that the ſubſtance of the one, ſtarts vp, and vaniſheth in the other; yee loſe the relation, and ſo yee loſe the Sacrament. Then as in euery Sacrament there is a relation; ſo to keepe the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yee muſt euer keepe two things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">The heads to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in this Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> for the better vnderſtanding &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of theſe two diuerſe things, which are relatiue to others, wee ſhall keepe this order by Gods grace. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I will let you ſee what is meant by a ſigne in the Sacrament. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next, I wil let you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what is meant by the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, how they two are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled; by what power and vertue they are conioyned; &amp; from whence this power and vertue floweth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, and laſt of all, I will let you vnderſtand, whether one and the ſelfe ſame inſtrument, giues the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, or not; whether they be giuen in one action, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20181:7"/>two; whether they be offred to one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or two; or if they be giuen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one manner, or two, to both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. Marke theſe diuerſities; the diuerſe manner of the receiuing, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of the Inſtruments, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of the giuers: and yee ſhall finde little difficultie in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now, to beginne at the ſignes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſeeing all Sacraments are ſignes,
<note place="margin">The ſignes in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> what call wee the ſignes in the Sacrament? I call the ſignes in the Sacrament, whatſoeuer I perceiue, and take vp by my outward ſenſes, by mine eye eſpecially. Now ye ſee in this Sacrament, there are two ſorts of things ſubiect to the outward ſenſes, &amp; to the eye eſpecially: yee ſee the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine are ſubiect to mine eye; therfore they muſt be ſignes. Yee ſee againe, that the rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whereby theſe Elements are diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, broken, and giuen, are ſubiect to mine eye alſo: Then I muſt make two ſorts of ſignes; one ſort of the Bread and the Wine, and we call them Elementall: another ſort of the rites &amp; ceremonies, whereby theſe are diſtributed, broken,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:8"/>and giuen, and wee call them ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. Be not deceiued with the vvord Ceremonie; thinke not, that I call the breaking of the Bread, the eating of the Bread, and drinking of the Wine, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: thinke not that they are vaine, as yee vſe that word Ceremonie for a vaine thing, which hath no grace, nor profit, following after it. No, although I call them Ceremonies, there is neuer a Ceremonie which Chriſt inſtituted in this Supper, but it is as eſſentiall, as the Bread and Wine are, and yee cannot leaue one iot of them, except yee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the whole inſtitution: for what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Chriſt commaunded to be done, what euer he ſpake, or did, in that whole action, it is eſſentiall, and muſt be done; and yee cannot leaue one iot thereof, but yee vvill peruert the vvhole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The reaſon, wherefore I call them ſignes,
<note place="margin">Why they are called ſignes.</note> is this: I call them not ſignes by that reaſon that men commonly call them ſignes, becauſe they ſignifie onely; as the Bread ſignifies the body of Chriſt, &amp; the Wine ſignifies the bloud of Chriſt:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20181:8"/>I call them not ſignes becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent onely; but I call them ſignes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue the body and bloud of Chriſt conioyned with them. Yea, ſo truly is the body of Chriſt conioyned with that Bread, and the bloud of Chriſt conioyned with that Wine, that as ſoone as thou receiueſt that Bread in thy mouth (if thou be a faithful man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) ſo ſoone receiueſt thou the bodie of Chriſt in thy ſoule, and that by faith: and as ſoone as thou receiueſt that Wine in thy mouth, ſo ſoone thou receiueſt the bloud of Chriſt in thy ſoule, and that by faith: In reſpect of this exhibition chiefely, that they are inſtruments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer, and exhibite the things that they ſignifie, and not in reſpect onely of their repreſentation, are they called ſignes. For if they did nothing but repreſent, or ſignifie a thing abſent; then any picture, or dead Image ſhould be a Sacrament: for there is no picture, as the picture of the King, but at the ſight of the picture, the King vvill come in your minde, and it vvill ſignifie vnto you, that, that is the Kings picture: So, if the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:9"/>ſigne of the Sacrament did no further, all pictures ſhould bee Sacraments: but in reſpect the Sacrament exhibites, and deliuers the thing that it ſignifieth, to the ſoule and hart, ſo ſoone as the ſigne is deliuered to the mouth, for this cauſe eſpecially, it is called a ſigne. There is no picture of the King, that will deliuer the King vnto you; there is no other Image, that will exhibite the thing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is the Image: therefore there is no Image can be a Sacrament. Then, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Lord hath appointed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as hands to deliuer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite the thing ſignified, for this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, and exhibition chiefely, they are called ſignes. As the word of the Goſpel, is a mighty &amp; potent inſtrument to our euerlaſting ſaluation: ſo the Sacrament is a potent inſtrument, appointed by GOD, to deliuer vs to Chriſt Ieſus, to our euerlaſting ſaluation. For this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meat, is dreſſed, and giuen vp to vs in ſpirituall diſhes: that is, in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word, and in the miniſtery of the Sacraments. And ſuppoſe this miniſtery be externall, yet the Lord is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20181:9"/>ſaid to deliuer ſpirituall, and heauenlie things, by theſe externall things. Why? Becauſe hee hath appointed them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, whereby he will deliuer his owne Sonne vnto vs. For this is certain, that none hath power to deliuer Chriſt Ieſus vnto vs, except God, and his holy ſpirit: and therefore, to ſpeake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is none can deliuer Chriſt, but God by his owne ſpirit: hee is deliuered by the miniſtery of the holy Spirit; it is the holy Spirit, that ſeales him vp in our harts, and confirmes vs more and more in him: as the Apoſtle giues him this ſtile, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak properly, there is none hath power to deliuer Chriſt, but GOD the Father, or himſelfe. There is none hath power to deliuer the Mediator, but his owne ſpirit: yet it hath pleaſed GOD, to vſe ſome inſtruments and means, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee will deliuer Chriſt Ieſus vnto vs. The meanes are theſe; the miniſtery of the vvord, and the miniſtery of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; and in reſpect he vſeth theſe as meanes, to deliuer Chriſt, they are ſaid to deliuer him. But heere yee haue
<pb facs="tcp:20181:10"/>to diſtinguiſh, between the principall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient deliuerer, and the inſtrumentall efficient; which is, the word, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: keeping this diſtinction, both theſe are true; GOD by his word, and GOD by his ſpirit, deliuereth Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus vnto you. Then I ſay, I cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſignes, becauſe God hath made them potent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to deliuer that ſame thing which they ſignifie.</p>
            <p>Now I goe to the thing ſignified, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and I call the thing ſignified by the ſignes in the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">What is the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Sacrament.</note> that, which <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that old Writer, calleth, the heauenly &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing: to wit, whole Chriſt, with his whole gifts, benefites, and graces, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, &amp; giuen to my ſoule. Then I call not the thing ſignified, by the ſignes of Bread and Wine; the benefits of Chriſt, the graces of Chriſt, or the vertue that floweth out of Chriſt onely: but I call the thing ſignified, together with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, and vertues flowing from him, the very ſubſtance of Chriſt himſelfe, from which this vertue dooth flowe. The ſubſtance, with the vertues, gifts, and graces, that flowe from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20181:10"/>is the thing ſignified heere. As for the vertue and graces that flow from Chriſt, it is not poſsible that thou canſt be partaker of the vertue that floweth from his ſubſtance, except thou be firſt partaker of the ſubſtance it ſelfe. For how is it poſsible, that I can be partaker of the iuyce that floweth out of any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, except I be partaker of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſelfe firſt?</p>
            <p>Is it poſsible that my ſtomach can bee refreſhed with that meat, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance vvhereof came neuer in my mouth? Is it poſsible my drouth can be ſlackned with that drinke, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed neuer downe my throat? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that I can ſucke any vertue out of anie thing, except I gette the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance firſt? So it is impoſsible, that I can get the iuyce &amp; vertue, that floweth out of Chriſt, except I get the ſubſtance, that is himſelfe, firſt. So I call not the thing ſignified, the grace, &amp; vertue that floweth from Chriſt onelie; nor Chriſt himſelfe, and his ſubſtance, without his vertue &amp; graces onely; but ioyntly, the ſubſtance with the graces, whole Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:11"/>God, and man, without ſeparation of his natures, without diſtinguiſhing of his ſubſtance from his graces.</p>
            <p>I call the thing ſignified, by the ſignes in the Sacrament: for why? if no more be ſignified by the Bread, but the fleſh, and body of Chriſt onely, and no more be ſignified by the Wine, but the bloud of Chriſt onely, thou canſt not ſay, that the body of Chriſt, is Chriſt; it is but a part of Chriſt: thou canſt not ſay, that the blood of Chriſt, is whole Chriſt; it is but a part of him: and a peece of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, ſaued thee not; a part of thy Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, wrought not the worke of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: and ſo ſuppoſe thou get a peece of him in the Sacrament, that part will doe thee no good.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore, that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may nouriſh thee to life euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou muſt get in it thy whole Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whole Chriſt, God, and man, with his whole graces, and benefites, without ſeparation of his ſubſtance, from his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or of the one nature, from the other. And how get I him? Not by my mouth. It is a vaine thing to think, that wee will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20181:11"/>get God by our mouth: but we get him by faith. As hee is a ſpirit, ſo I eate him by faith; and belieue in my ſoule, not by the teeth of my mouth: that is a vaine thing. Be it, that thou mighteſt eate the fleſh of Chriſt with thy teeth, this were a cruel maner of doing; yet thou maiſt not eate the God-head with thy teeth: this is a groſs faſhion of ſpeaking. Then if euer yee get good of the Sacrament, ye muſt get whole Chriſt; and there is not any inſtrument whereby to lay hold on him, but by faith onely: therefore come with a faithfull hart.</p>
            <p>O, but yee will aske mee (and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the definition layd downe of the thing ſignified, giues a ground to it) If the fleſh of Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſtion. </seg>
               </label> and the bloud of Chriſt, bee a part of the thing ſignified, how can I call his fleſh a ſpirituall thing; and Chriſt, in reſpect of his fleſh, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thing? Yee will not ſay, that the ſubſtance of Chriſtes fleſh is ſpirituall, or that the ſubſtance of his bloud, is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; vvherefore then call ye it an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, and ſpiritual thing? I wil tell you. The fleſh of Chriſt, is called a ſpirituall
<pb facs="tcp:20181:12"/>thing, and Chriſt is called ſpirituall, in reſpect of his fleſh: not, that his fleſh is become a ſpirit; or that the ſubſtance of his fleſh, is become ſpirituall. No, it remaineth true fleſh, and the ſubſtance of it, is one, as it was in the wombe of the Virgin. His fleſh is not called ſpirituall, in reſpect it is glorified in the heauens, at the right hand of the Father; be not deceiued with that: for ſuppoſe it be glorified, yet it remaineth true fleſh, that ſame verie fleſh which hee tooke out of the wombe of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Neither is it ſpirituall, becauſe thouſeeſt it not in the Supper; if thou wert where it is,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
               </label> thou mighteſt ſee it: But it is called ſpirituall, in reſpect of the ſpirituall ends wherunto it ſerues to my body &amp; ſoule, becauſe the fleſh &amp; bloud of Chriſt, ſerueth to nouriſh me, not to a temporall, but to a ſpirituall, &amp; heauenly life. Now, in reſpect this fleſh is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual foode, ſeruing me to a ſpirituall life, for this cauſe it is called a ſpirituall thing: if it nouriſh mee, as the fleſh of beaſts doth, but to a temporall life, it ſhould be called but a temporall thing:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20181:12"/>but in reſpect it nouriſheth my ſoule, not to an earthly and temporall life, but to an heauenly, celeſtiall, and ſpirituall end; In reſpect of this end, the fleſh of Chriſt, and Chriſt in reſpect of his fleſh, is called the ſpirituall thing in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is called alſo the ſpiritual thing in the Sacrament, in reſpect of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall inſtrument, whereby it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The inſtrument whereby the fleſh of Chriſt is receiued, is not a corporall inſtrument; is not the teeth, and mouth of the body; but it is ſpirituall; it is the mouth of the ſoule, which is faith: and in reſpect the inſtrument is ſpirituall, therefore Chriſt, who is receiued, is alſo called ſpirituall. In reſpect alſo, that the manner of receiuing, is a heauenly, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and internall manner; not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, nor externall manner: in reſpect that the fleſh of Chriſt, which is giuen in the Sacrament, is receiued by a ſpiritual, &amp; ſecret maner, which is not ſeene to the eyes of men; In all theſe reſpects, I call Chriſt Ieſus the heauenly and ſpirituall thing, which is ſignified by the ſignes in the Sacrament.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:13"/>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">The thing ſignified, muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> I ſay in the end, the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied muſt bee applyed to vs. What auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it me, to ſee my medicine in a box, ſtanding in an Apothecaries ſhop? what can it worke toward me, if it be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed? What auaileth it mee to ſee my ſaluation afarre of, if it be not applied to mee? Therefore, it is not enough for vs, to ſee Chriſt, but he muſt be giuen vs, or elſe he cannot worke health and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in vs. And as this ſaluation is giuen vs, wee muſt haue a mouth to take it. What auaileth it mee, to ſee meat before me, except I haue a mouth to take it? So, the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, muſt be giuen vs, by God, by the Three perſons of the Trinitie, one GOD; by Chriſt Ieſus, who muſt giue himſelfe: &amp; as he giues himſelfe, ſo wee muſt haue a mouth to take him. Suppoſe he preſent, and offer himſelfe, yet he can profit, and auaile none but them, who haue a mouth to receiue him. Then ye ſee, what I call the thing ſignified: whole Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to vs, and receiued by vs: vvhole Chriſt, God, and man, without ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his natures; vvithout diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20181:13"/>of his ſubſtance from his graces, <hi>All applyed to vs.</hi> Then, I ſay, ſeeing we come to the Sacrament to be fed by his fleſh, and refreſhed by his bloud, to be fed to an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, and ſpirituall life: and ſeeing there is no profit to be had at this Table, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome kinde of preparation; therefore let no man preaſe to come to this holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except in ſome meaſure hee be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Some will be prepared in a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then others; alwayes, let no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to go to it, except, in ſome meaſure, his heart be ſanctified: therefore, my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation concerning the way, whereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of you ought to prepare your ſelues, that yee may fit you the better to this Table, is this; there is not one of you, that commeth to the Table of the Lord, that may bring before the Lord, his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, iuſtice, and vprightnes: but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer goeth to the Table of the Lord, hee ought to goe, with the acknowledging, &amp; confeſsion of his miſery: he ought to goe with a ſorrowfull hart, for the ſinnes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath offended God; he ought to goe with a hatred of thoſe ſinnes. Not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that hee is holy, iuſt, and vpright:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:14"/>but to proteſt, and confeſſe, that he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and of all creatures the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable: and therefore hee goeth to that Table, to get ſupport for his miſery, to obtaine mercy, at the throne of Grace: to get remiſſion, and forgiuenes of his ſinnes; to get the gift of repentance, that more, &amp; more, he may ſtudy to liue vprightly, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and ſoberly in all time to come. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, except yee haue entred into this courſe, and haue a purpoſe to continue in this courſe; to amend your life paſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you of your ſinnes, and by the grace of God, to liue more vprightly, and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then yee haue done, for Gods cauſe goe not to the Table. For, where there is not a purpoſe to doe well, and to repent, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, there muſt be a purpoſe to doe ill: and whoſoeuer commeth to that Table, with a purpoſe to doe ill, and without a purpoſe to repent, he commeth to mock Chriſt, to ſcorne him to his face, &amp; to eate his owne preſent-condemnation. So, let no man come to that Table, that hath not in his hart a purpoſe to doe better, that hath not a hart to ſorrow for his ſinnes paſt, and thinketh not his former follie, and madneſſe ouer-great: Let no man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20181:14"/>come to that Table, without this, vnder the paine of condemnation. But if yee haue in your hart, a purpoſe to doe better, ſuppoſe your former life hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and looſe; yet, if yee be touched in your harts, with any feeling or remorſe of your life paſt, goe not from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but come vvith a proteſtation of your miſery and wretchedneſſe, and come with a heart to gette grace: if vvith a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute life (I meane not of open ſlaunders) thou haue alſo a purpoſe not to amend, but to doe vvorſe, for Gods ſake ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of the thing ſignified. Vnto this generall conſideration, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth theſe things yet to bee made plaine vnto you: Firſt, how the ſignes, and the thing ſignified are coupled together, and how they are conioyned. Next, it reſtes to be told you, how the ſigne is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and hovv the thing ſignified is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, and hovv both are receiued, as vvell as they are deliuered. This bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, I ſhall ſpeake briefely of the other part of the Sacrament, vvhich is the vvord. And laſt of all, I ſhall let you
<pb facs="tcp:20181:15"/>ſee, what ſort of faults they are, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the Sacrament, and make it of no effect. And if time ſhall ſerue, I ſhall enter in particular, to this Sacrament which wee haue in hand.</p>
            <p>Then to come back againe; In the third place,
<note place="margin">How the ſigne &amp; the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> it is to be conſidered, how the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, are coupled: For, about this coniunction, all the debate ſtands; all the ſtrifes, that we haue vvith them that varie from the ſtreight truth, ſtand about the matter of this coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some will haue them conioyned one way, and ſome, after another way; &amp; men ſtriue very bitterly about this matter; and continue ſo in ſtrife, that through the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of contention, they loſe the truth: for when the heat of contention ariſeth, &amp; eſpecially in diſputation, they take no heed to the truth, but to the victory. If they may be victorious, and it were but by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of words, they regard not, ſuppoſe they loſe the truth. Read their works, and bookes about this coniunction, and you will craue, rather conſcience, then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: yea, if they had the quarter of the conſcience, that they haue of knowledge, no queſtion, this controuerſie might bee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20181:15"/>eaſily taken vp: but men lacking conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hauing knowledge, an euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience peruerts the knowledge, &amp; drawes them to an euill end.</p>
            <p>To tell you now, how theſe two are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, it will be farre eaſier for mee, and better for you to vnderſtand, to tell you firſt, how they are not conioyned: for I ſhall make it very cleere vnto you, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you ſee how they are not conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but it is not poſsible to make it ſo cleere, by telling you the manner, hovv they are conioyned. Yee may perceiue cleerely by your eyes, that the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, are not locally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned: that is, they are not both in one place. Yee may perceiue alſo by your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes, that the body of Chriſt, which is the thing ſignified, &amp; the ſignes, are not conioyned corporally, their bodies touch not each other. You may perceiue alſo, they are not viſibly conioyned, they are not both ſubiect to the outward eye: So it is eaſie to let you ſee, how they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned. For if the ſigne, and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified were viſibly, and corporally conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what need were there for vs to haue a ſigne? Wherefore ſhould the ſigne in the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:16"/>Sacrament ſerue vs? Is not the ſigne in the Sacrament, appointed to leade mee to Chriſt? Is not the ſigne appointed to point out Chriſt vnto mee? If I ſaw him preſent by mine owne eye, as I doe the Bread, vvhat need had I of the Bread? Therefore ye may ſee cleerely, that there is no ſuch thing, as a corporall, naturall, or any ſuch like phyſicall coniunction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified: So I ſay, it is eaſie to let you ſee, how they are not conioyned.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs ſee how they are conioyned. VVe cannot craue heere any other ſort of coniunction, then may ſtand &amp; agree with the nature of the Sacrament: for, nothing can be conioyned with another, after any other ſort, then the nature of it will ſuffer; therefore, there cannot be heere any other ſort of coniunction, then the nature of the Sacrament will ſuffer. Now, the nature of the Sacrament, will ſuffer a Sacramentall coniunction. O, but that is hard yet, yee are neuer the better for this; but I ſhall make it cleere by Gods grace. Yee knowe euery Sacrament is a myſterie; there is not a Sacrament but it containes a high, &amp; diuine myſterie. In reſpect then, that a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20181:16"/>Sacrament is a myſterie, it followeth, that a myſticall ſecret, and ſpirituall coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, agreeth well vvith the nature of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>As the coniunction betweene vs, and Chriſt, is full of myſterie, as the Apoſtle lets you ſee, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.32. that it is a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and ſpirituall coniunction: So no doubt, the coniunction between the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the thing ſignified in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, muſt be of that ſame nature, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, and ſpirituall. It is not poſsible to tel you, by any ocular demonſtration, how Chriſt and we are conioyned. But whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer would vnderſtand that coniunction, his minde muſt be enlightened vvith an heauenly eye; that as he hath an eye in his head, to ſee corporall things: ſo he muſt haue in his mind &amp; hart, an heauenly eye, to ſee this myſticall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction; a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eye, to take vp this ſecret coniunction, that is betwixt the ſonne of God, and vs, in the Sacrament. So I need not to inſiſt any longer heerupon: except ye haue this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly illumination, yee can neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand neither your own coniunction with Chriſt, nor yet the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction between the ſign, &amp; the thing ſignified in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:17"/>
            <p>But I keepe my ground: As the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a myſterie; ſo the coniunction that is in the Sacrament, no doubt muſt be a myſticall ſecret, and ſpirituall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Beſides this, I will let you ſee by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deduction, that in euery Sacrament, are two things; which two, haue a relation, and mutuall reſpect the one to the other: ſo that a relatiue coniunction, agreeth wel with the nature of the Sacrament. Then wilt thou aske, what kinde of coniunction it is? I anſwere, the coniunction that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth in nature: to wit, a relatiue, and a reſpectiue coniunction; ſuch a coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein the ſigne hath a continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the thing ſignified; and the thing ſignified, to the ſigne.</p>
            <p>Then, would you knowe in a word, the kinde of coniunction, that is betweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified? I call it a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and a myſticall coniunction, that ſtandeth in a mutuall relation, betweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified. There is another coniunction, beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction that is betweene Chriſt and vs, that may make this coniunction betwixt the ſigne, and the thing ſignified in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, more cleere: and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20181:17"/>which is between the word which you heare,
<note place="margin">This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction is made cleer, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the word, &amp; the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied therby.</note> and the thing ſignified by the ſame word. Mark what ſort of coniunction is betweene the word which you heare, and the thing ſignified which commeth into your minde; the like coniunction is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſigne that you ſee, and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue eaſily, that there is a coniunction, by the effect, although you cannot ſo vvell knowe the manner of coniunction. And why? You heare not the word ſo ſoon ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by mee, but incontinent, the thing, which my words whereof I ſpeak, ſignifie, commeth into your minde. If I ſpeake of things paſt, of things to come, or of things that are neuer ſo farre abſent, I can no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpeak to you of them in this language, but preſently the thing ſignified, commeth into your minde; no doubt, becauſe there is a coniunction between the word, and the thing ſignified: So euery one of you may eaſily perceiue, that there is a coniunction between the word, and the thing ſignified by the word. As for example: Suppoſe <hi>Paris</hi> be far diſtant from vs; yet if I ſpeake of <hi>Paris,</hi> the word is no ſooner ſpoken, but the Citie will come into your minde. If I
<pb facs="tcp:20181:18"/>ſpeake of the King, although hee be farre diſtant from vs, the word is no ſooner ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the thing ſignified will come into your mind: So this comming of the thing ſignified into the hart, and minde, maketh it plaine vnto you, that there is a coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene the word, and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the word.</p>
            <p>To tell you of this ſort of coniunction, it is not ſo eaſie, becauſe the thing ſignified is not preſent vnto the eye, as the word is to the eare. If euery thing ſignified, were as preſent vnto your eye, as the word is to your eare, it were eaſie to ſee the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but novv ſeeing the coniunction is myſticall, ſecret, and ſpirituall, therefore it is hard to make you to vnderſtand it: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obſerue, What coniunction is between the ſimple word, and the thing ſignified by the word; the ſame kinde of coniunction, is between the Sacrament, and the thing ſignified by the Sacrament: for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is no other thing, but a viſible word. I call it a viſible word, why? becauſe it conueyes the ſignification of it, by the eye, to the minde; as this is an audible word, becauſe it conueyeth the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, by the eare to the minde.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:20181:18"/>
            <p>In the Sacrament, ſo often as yee looke on it, ye ſhall no ſooner ſee that Bread with your eye, but the body of Chriſt ſhal come into your mind; ye ſhal no ſooner ſee that Wine, but after the preaching, and opening vp of the parts of the Sacrament, the bloud of Chriſt ſhall come into your mind.</p>
            <p>Now, this coniunction, betweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtandeth chiefely, as yee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in two things. Firſt, in a relation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified; which ariſeth from a likenes, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt them two: for if there vvere no proportion, &amp; analogie betweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified by the ſigne, there could not be a Sacrament, or a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So the firſt part of this coniunction, ſtandeth in a relation, which ariſeth, from a certaine ſimilitude and likenes, which the one hath with the other. And this likenes may be eaſily perceiued: for looke how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the bread is to nouriſh thy body to this life earthly &amp; temporall; the fleſh of Chriſt ſignified by the bread, is as able to nouriſh both body &amp; ſoule to life euerlaſting: ſo ye may perceiue ſome kinde of proportion between the ſigne, and the thing ſignified.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:19"/>
            <p>The ſecond point of the coniunction, ſtandeth in a continuall &amp; mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the one with the other; in ſuch ſort, that the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, are offered both together, receiued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at one time, and in one action; the one, outwardly; the other, inwardly; if ſo bee that thou haſt a mouth in thy ſoule, which is faith, to receiue it. Then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of the coniunction, ſtandeth in a ioynt offering, and in a ioynt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: and this I call a concurrence. Then, would you knowe what manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction is between the ſigne, &amp; the thing ſignified? I ſay, it is a relatiue coniunction; a ſecret and a myſtical coniunction, which ſtandeth in a mutuall relation. There is no more to be obſerued heerein, but this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if yee conioyne theſe two, yee be carefull not to confound them: beware that ye turne not the one into the other, but keepe either of them, in his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, without confuſion, or permixtion of the one, with the other; and ſo ye ſhall haue the lawfull coniunction, that ſhould be in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>There is not a leſſon that can be learned out of this, at the leaſt that I can marke or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20181:19"/>gather, except only the leſſon of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and goodnes of the euerliuing God, who hath inuented ſo many wonderfull ſorts of coniunction, and all to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that wee might be conioyned to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance this great, &amp; myſticall coniunction, betwixt the God of glory, and vs: In the which coniunction, our weale, felicity, and happineſſe in this life, and in the life to come doth onely ſtand: That he is ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to conioyne himſelfe, with his word and Sacraments; that we, in his word, and Sacraments, might be conioyned vvith him.</p>
            <p>If wee were mooued with the care, and loue of God, expreſſed in theſe coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though it were neuer ſo little on our parts, aſſuredly, we would neuer defraude our ſelues, of the fruit of that happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, nor bring it in ſuch a loathing &amp; diſdaine, as we doe this day: for we by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and preferring of our pleaſures, to Chriſt &amp; his counſell, haue made the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks of our ſoules, ſo foule, and ill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that either they receiue him not at all; or if he be receiued, hee is not able to tary. And why? becauſe a foule ſtomack is not able to keepe him: for incontinent vvee
<pb facs="tcp:20181:20"/>choke him ſo, either with the luſts of the fleſh, or with the cares of this world, that he is compelled to depart. And if Chriſt be not both deuoured, and digeſted, hee can doe vs no good: and this digeſtion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, where there is not a greedy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, to the receit of him; for, if thou be not hungry for him, he is not ready for thee: And I am aſſured, if all the men in the Countrey were examined by this rule, that there were none that receiue Chriſt, but he that hath a ſtomack, and is hungry for him, I doubt that few ſhould be found to receiue him. I feare that vvee haue taken ſuch a lothing, and diſdaine, of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly foode, that there is not ſuch a thing, as any kinde of hunger, or appetite of it in our ſoules. And vvhat is the cauſe of this? I will tell you: Suppoſe wee haue renounced the corporall and groſſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, wherein our Fathers were plunged, and drowned, &amp; which men in ſome parts, goe about to erect now: yet as the maners of this Countrey, and the behauiour of euery one of vs doth teſtifie, there is not a man that hath renounced that damnable Idoll, that hee hath in his ovvne ſoule; nor the inuiſible Idolatry, that hee hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20181:20"/>in his owne hart and mind. There is not a man, but to that ſame Idoll, wherewith hee was conceiued, &amp; borne, &amp; whereunto he addicted himſelfe, and was a ſlaue before, but to that Idoll, he giueth his ſeruice yet. And therefore maruaile not, when thou haſt addicted thy ſeruice, ſet thy affection, and poured out thy hart, vpon that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thine owne, vpon that Idoll of thine owne, vpon that luſt, and miſchiefe of thine owne, maruaile not if thou haue no appetite to Chriſt, nor to that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foode.</p>
            <p>When thou haſt thy ſoule poured forth on ſome villanie, and vvickedneſſe, and haſt ſent it farre afield, how is it poſsible for thee to retire it, &amp; draw it home againe, to imploy it, where thou ſhouldeſt, on Chriſt Ieſus? Then, let euery one in his owne ranke, take heed to his owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Idoll, that lodgeth vvithin his owne hart, and preaſe to cleare himſelfe of it; or otherwiſe, yee cannot ſee the face of Chriſt, nor be partakers of his kingdome.</p>
            <p>There is not another leſſon in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie but this: this is the firſt, &amp; the laſt leſſon, to ſhake off your luſts &amp; affections,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:21"/>peece and peece, and ſo by little and little renounce thy ſelfe, that thou maiſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt. I grant there is a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in this poynt, in ſome, then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſome leſſe, ſome more profit in this: but, except in ſome meaſure, yee caſt off your ſelues, &amp; whatſoeuer in your own eyes yee account moſt precious, to come by Chriſt, yee are not worthy of him. And this is very hard to be done: It is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for a man to ſpeake it, to bid a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his owne Idol, which I call his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but it is not ſo ſoone done: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, a ſtronger muſt come in, to caſt out the affections; yea, a ſtronger then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell muſt come in to driue out the diuell, who maketh reſidence in the affection, or elſe he will remaine there for euer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are not many, that haue renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelues; and examine thine heart when thou wilt, if there be any thing in the world, that thou loueſt better then Chriſt: If thou be not content to leaue father and mother, to leaue wife &amp; children, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is deareſt vnto thee in this world, for Chriſt, thou art not worthy of him. If thou be not content to caſt off whatſoeuer maketh thee a ſtranger to Chriſt, thou art
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20181:21"/>not worthy of him. And is this a ſmall matter, ſeeing there is no part, or power of our ſoules, but it is enemy to this, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines againſt this heauenly coniunction? Is this an eaſie thing, to caſt off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ourſelues, that wee may come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt? There is no greater thing then this; it hath not entred into euery hart, to conſider of this; for this worke of our new creation, is tenne thouſand times greater, then the worke of our firſt creation: and therefore it is moſt neceſſary, that euerie man take heede vnto himſelfe; for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is ſo crafty in this point, that hee erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euer, one I doll or other in our ſoules; and ſometimes vnder the ſhew of vertue: which of all, is moſt dangerous. And in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery worke that wee take in hand, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo holy, hee is at our right hand, and maketh himſelf to haue intereſt in it: and hee contents himſelfe not with this, vnder the ſhew of vertue to corrupt vs, but hee is ſo watchfull, that euen in the beſt actions, and when yee are beſt occupied in your moſt vertuous actions, hee mixeth them with ſinnes, and ſo doth all that lyeth in him, to make you loſe your profit, and loſe your rewards. For, when yee are beſt
<pb facs="tcp:20181:22"/>occupied, he goeth about to engender in you, an opinion of your ſelues, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraude God of his glory. Or otherwiſe, in dooing of good deedes, he maketh you ſo ſlack, and negligent, that if ye do them, ye doe them coldly, or ſo indiſcreetly, that he makes you begin at the laſt, firſt, and makes it that ſhould be firſt, laſt; and ſo, as <hi>Martha</hi> was, to be occupied, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſie in thoſe things, which are not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as the things wherin <hi>Mary</hi> was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied: for, ſhe ſhould haue preferred, firſt the hearing of the word, to the preparing of Chriſts Supper. This is but to giue you an in-ſight, and to let you ſee, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is ſo craftie, that either he caſteth in, a falſe conceit of our ſelues, in dooing any good deed, or elſe, makes vs to doe that laſt, which ſhould be firſt; or then makes vs altogether ſo ſluggiſh, and ſo negligent, that wee do the worke of the Lord coldly: &amp; ſo, one way, or other, he holdeth vs euer in a continuall buſineſs, ſo that we cannot be halfe watchful enough. For, we haue to do with principalities &amp; powers, with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wickedneſſes, which are aboue vs, and within vs alſo; for, there is not that man, that hath corruption within him, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is in him: we cannot therfore be halfe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20181:22"/>watchfull, or ſtudious enough, to caſt out the diuel, to renounce our ſelues, &amp; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vs vnto the obedience of Chriſt. Thus farre concerning the coniunction.</p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing that the ſigne,
<note place="margin">How the ſigne, &amp; the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; receiued. Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> &amp; the thing ſignified, are diuerſe, it reſteth to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, how the ſigne is deliuered, and how the thing ſignified is deliuered; and after what manner they are receiued. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning this, ye haue theſe things to marke. Firſt, to conſider,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whether the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you, by one man, or not.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to conſider, whether the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, be deliuered vnto you, in in one action, or not. Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vvhether both theſe things be giuen, by one inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or not. And fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ye are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether the ſign, &amp; the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be offered, &amp; receiued, after one maner, or not. Now, after that ye haue conſidered all theſe, in the end, yee ſhall find, that the ſigne, &amp; the thing ſignified, are not giuen by one perſon. Yee ſhall finde next, that they are not giuen in one ſort of action. Thirdly, yee ſhall finde, that they are not both offered, &amp; giuen by one inſtrument. And fourthly, ye ſhal find, that they are not
<pb facs="tcp:20181:23"/>both giuen, and receiued, after one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. So, finding this diuerſitie, yee haue this to doe: marke the diuerſity of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers and giuers: marke the diuerſitie of the actions: marke, thirdly, the diuerſitie of the inſtruments: and fourthly, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe manner of receiuing. Marke all theſe diligently, and ye ſhall finde little difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the Sacrament. And firſt to make it cleare vnto you, I ſay, that the ſigne, &amp; the thing ſignified by the ſigne, are not both giuen by one; and this ye ſee plainly. For, as for the ſigne, that Bread, &amp; that Wine: yee ſee your ſelues, that the Miniſter offers vnto you the ſigne, he giues you that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; as that ſigne is an earthly, and corporall thing, ſo it is an earthly, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall man that giues it. Now, the thing ſignified, is of another nature: for it is an heauenly and ſpirituall thing; therefore this heauenly thing, is not giuen by an earthly man; this incorruptible thing, is not giuen by a naturall and corruptible man. But Chriſt Ieſus hath locked vp, and reſerued the miniſterie of this heauenlie thing, to himſelfe onely: therefore, there are two giuers in this Sacrament; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter giueth the earthly thing; Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20181:23"/>the Mediator, giues you the heauenly thing in this Sacrament. For Chriſt, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the earthly thing, will not vſe his own miniſtery immediatly, nor the miniſterie of an Angell, but onely the miniſterie of an earthly man. And as for the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne body, and bloud, he will not giue it, either to heauenly creature, or earthly man; but he keepeth this miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to himſelfe, and he diſpenſeth his own body and bloud, to whom, and when hee pleaſeth. And vvhy? If any man in the world, had power to giue Chriſtes body, and bloud, no queſtion, this man ſhould haue power to clenſe the hart and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for the bloud of Chriſt, hath this power with it; and conſequently, ſhould haue power to forgiue ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Now, it is onely GOD that may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue ſinnes; and therfore it is not poſsible, that the miniſtery of the heauenly thing, can be in the power of any man. Example we haue in <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.11. Saith he not, The miniſtery that I haue, is of the element; I am commaunded to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the element of water onely: but as for the miniſterie of the fire, and of the ſpirit, Chriſt hath reſerued it vnto himſelf.
<pb facs="tcp:20181:24"/>Therefore, looke not to get the ſpirit at mans hands, but at the hands of Chriſt himſelfe onely; and without this inward miniſtery, the outward miniſtery is not worth a ſtraw. For, my outward miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, yea, ſuppoſe it were the miniſterie of an Angell, and ſuppoſe Chriſt were preſent in the fleſh, to miniſter vnto you theſe outward things, except hee conioyne the inward miniſterie of his ſpirit therewith, it availes nothing: it may well be as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt you, againſt the day of that generall aſſembly; but to your ſaluation, it will neuer profit you. Therefore, this yee ought alwaies to pray for, that the Lord would water your harts, by his holy ſpirit, as he watereth your eares, by the hearing of his vvord. Then there are two offerers; the Miniſter offers the ſigne, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus offers himſelfe, the thing ſignified. The three perſons, one GOD, offers the Mediatour, or the Mediatour offers himſelfe, and that by the power, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his owne Spirit.</p>
            <p>As there are two offerers,
<note place="margin">The ſign, &amp; the thing ſignified, are offered in two actions, by two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, &amp; after two manners.</note> two perſons that offer, and giue the Sacrament, and thing ſignified by the Sacrament: ſo theſe two, are offered, and giuen in two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20181:24"/>Chriſt, vvho is the heauenly thing, is offered, and giuen vnto you, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſecret, and ſpirituall action, which is not ſubiect to the outward eye. The ſigne againe, is offered and giuen, in an outward action, after a corporall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner. As there are two ſorts of actions; ſo there are two ſorts of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvhere-unto the ſigne, and the thing ſignified are offered: for, the thing ſingified, that is, Chriſt, is neuer offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the mouth of my body: the bloud of Chriſt, the fleſh of Chriſt, whole Chriſt, or the ſpirit of Chriſt, is not offered, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the word, nor in the Sacrament, to the mouth of my body. Let the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries finde me that in any part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there is any other manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing Chriſt, then by faith, and let them haue the victorie. So there is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, as I told you, neither hand, not mouth, to receiue Chriſt, but faith onely. As Chriſt, vvho is the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is receiued by the hand, &amp; mouth of faith: ſo the ſigne, which ſignifieth Chriſt, is receiued by our ovvne naturall mouth, &amp; hand: ye haue a mouth in your heads, and in your bodies, as proper to receiue
<pb facs="tcp:20181:25"/>the ſigne, as faith is to receiue Chriſt. So the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, are offered and giuen, not to one inſtrument, but to two; the one, to the mouth of the body; the other, to the mouth of the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Now, marke by what way theſe things are offered, and giuen, by the ſame vvay, they are receiued: as the ſigne is corporal, and naturally offered to a corporall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo is it receiued, after a corporall, &amp; naturall manner: for, thou muſt take the Bread, &amp; Wine, either by thy hand, or by thy mouth. The thing ſignified, is not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after a corporall manner, but after a ſecret, and ſpirituall manner: and as it is offered, ſo it is taken. There can be nothing clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then this; the one is taken after a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall manner, the other after a ſecret, &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner. So in this laſt part, ye haue theſe things to marke, to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the outward action, and the inward, between the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, and to keepe a proportion, and analogie between the inward, and the outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ye may ſurely perſwade your ſelues, that if ye be faithfull, Chriſt is as buſie, working inwardly in your ſoules, as the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20181:25"/>Miniſter is, working outwardly towards your bodies: looke how buſie the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is, in breaking that Bread, in pouring out that Wine, in giuing that Bread, and Wine, vnto thee, as buſie is Chriſt, in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his owne body to thee, and in giuing thee iuyce of his owne body, after a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and an inuiſible manner. So keepe this diſtinction, and yee may aſſure your ſelues, that by faith, Chriſt is as well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied towards your ſoules, to nouriſh them, as the Miniſter is outwardly towards your bodies. Keepe this, and yee haue the whole Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Then from this diſcourſe and deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you may learn a double matter, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Sacrament conſiſteth. It ſtandeth on two ſorts of materials; that is, of an earthly matter, and of an heauenly matter: the ſigne, and the thing ſignified. And as there is a double matter in the Sacrament: ſo the Sacrament muſt be handled after a double manner; by an outward action, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action: keep the diſtinction in theſe things, betweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, and ye ſhall not eaſily ſlip in the vnderſtanding of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>This beeing ſaid, concerning the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:20181:26"/>conſideration of the Elements (for all this yet appertaineth vnto the Elements) it reſteth that we ſpeake ſome-what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vvord,
<note place="margin">Of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is the word.</note> which I call the other part of the Sacrament. I meane &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the vvord, where-unto the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are annexed, that thing, vvhich quickneth this whole action, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, as it were a ſoule, and giueth life vnto the whole action. For, by the word, and appointment of Chriſt in the vvord, the Miniſter knoweth vvhat is his part, the hearer knoweth what is his part, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one is prepared, how to deliuer, and how to receiue; the Miniſter, how hee ſhould deliuer, and the hearer, how hee ſhold receiue. So the Inſtitution of Chriſt, is the quickning of the whole action: for, all the action is warranted from the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſet downe in his word. In the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, there are two things chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conſidered: a Commaund: and a Promiſe. The Commaund is this, where he ſaith, <hi>Take, eate.</hi> The Commaund re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth obedience. There is a Promiſe alſo in the inſtitution, and it is contained in theſe words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> The Promiſe craueth faith: as the Commaund craueth obedience; ſo the Promiſe craueth beliefe.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20181:26"/>Therefore come not vnto the Sacrament, except ye bring both faith and obedience with you. If thou come not with a heart minding to obey Chriſt, at the leaſt, more then thou waſt wont to doe, thou commeſt vnto thine ovvne damnation. And if thou bringeſt a hart voyd of faith, thou commeſt vnto thine owne damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So, let euery one that commeth vnto the Sacrament, bring with him a hart min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to doe better; that is, to obey, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue Chriſt, better then he did in time paſt. Except ye bring theſe two, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, come not vnto the Sacrament: for, whatſoeuer thou dooſt, except it flow from faith, it can profit nothing. Thus farre briefly concerning the word. Now it wil be demaunded, What need is there, that theſe Sacraments &amp; ſeales ſhould be annexed to the word? wherfore are they annexed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we get no more in the Sacrament, then we get in the word, and wee get as much in the very ſimple word, as we get in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments? Seeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we get no new thing in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but the ſame thing which we get in the ſimple word, wherefore is the Sacrament appointed to be hung vnto the word? It is tru certainly, that we get no new
<pb facs="tcp:20181:27"/>thing in the Sacrament, nor wee get no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in the Sacrament, then we get in the word: for what more wouldeſt thou craue, then to get the Sonne of God, if thou get him well? Thy hart cannot wiſh, nor imagine a greater gift, then to haue the Sonne of God, who is King of heauen, and earth: therefore, I ſay, VVhat new thing wouldeſt thou haue? for, if thou get him, thou getteſt all things with him; thy hart cannot imagine a new thing, beſides him. Wherefore then is the Sacrament appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>1</label> Not to get thee any new thing: I ſay it is appointed, to gette thee that ſame thing better,
<note place="margin">By the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, we poſſeſſe Chriſt more fully then by the ſimple vvord.</note> then thou haddeſt it in the vvord. The Sacrament is appointed, that we may take better hold of Chriſt, then we could in the ſimple vvord; that we may poſſeſſe Chriſt in our harts, and mindes, more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and largely, then we did before in the ſimple vvord. That Chriſt might haue a larger ſpace, to make reſidence in our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row harts, then he could haue, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſimple vvord; and to poſſeſſe Chriſt more fully, it is a better thing. For, ſuppoſe Chriſt be one thing in himſelfe, yet the better hold thou haſt of him, thou art the ſurer of his promiſe.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:20181:27"/>
            <p>The Sacraments are appointed, that I might haue him more fully in my ſoule; that I might haue the boundes of it enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he may make the better reſidence in me. This, no doubt, is the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Seales are annexed, to the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſimple word.</p>
            <p>They ſerue to this end alſo, to ſeale vp,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and confirme the truth that is in the word:
<note place="margin">They ſerue to confirme the truth contained in the vvord.</note> for as the office of the Seale hung to the Euidence, is not to confirme any other truth then that which is in the Euidence; and though ye belieued the Euidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet by the ſeales yee belieue it better: euen ſo the Sacraments aſſure me of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, then is contained vvithin the vvord: yet, becauſe it is a ſeale, annexed vnto the vvord, it perſwades me the better of the ſame: for the more the outvvard ſenſes are wakened, the more is the inward hart and minde perſwaded to belieue.</p>
            <p>Now the Sacrament wakeneth all the outward ſenſes, as the eye, the hand, and all the reſt: and the outward ſenſes beeing mooued, no queſtion, the ſpirit of GOD concurring there-with, moues the hart the more. The Sacraments are then annexed vnto the vvord, to ſeale vp the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb facs="tcp:20181:28"/>in the word, and to confirm it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re and more in thy hart. The word then is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to worke beliefe: and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is appointed to confirme you in this beliefe. But except yee feele the truth of this, inwardly in your harts; except yee haue your harts as ready as your mouth, thinke not that any thing will auaile you. All the ſeales in the world wil not work, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſpirit of God concur, and ſeale the ſame truth in your harts, which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeales outwardly: Except hee make cleere the ſight of thy minde inwardly, and worke a feeling in thy hart, both word, and Sacrament ſhall loſe their fruite and effect which they ſhould haue. All the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are full of this: the whole Scriptures of God, are but a ſlaying letter to you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſpirit of God concurre, to quicken inwardly.
<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Therefore your whole indeuour ſhould be, to preaſe to feele Chriſt inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your harts, that finding him in your harts, and ſeeing him in your minds, both word, and Sacraments may be effectuall: If not, your ſoules remaine dead, ye are not tranſlated from that death, wherin ye were conceiued. Therefore all the ſtudy of Chriſtians ſhould be, when they ſee the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20181:28"/>and heare the word, to labor to finde, and feele in their harts and mindes, that which they heare, and ſee; and this I call to finde Chriſt quick in your ovvne ſoules. This cannot be, except yee ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his lodging: for if all the corners of thy ſoule remaine a dunghill, Chriſt cannot dwell there: and therefore, except ye ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for continuall growth in ſanctification, &amp; ſeuer your ſelues from euery thing, that ſeuers you from Chriſt, it is not poſsible that hee can liue or dwell in you.</p>
            <p>This is a great leſſon, and it is not poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe this, except, as I haue ſaid, a ſtronger come in, &amp; poſſeſſe vs, and make vs to renounce our ſelues. Then the ſeales had not been annexed to the word, except for our cauſe: for, there is no neceſsity on Gods part, that God ſhould either ſweare, or confirme by ſeales, the thing that hee hath ſpoken: for, his word is as good, as any oath or ſeale. But the neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of vs: there is ſuch a great weakneſſe in vs, that vvhen hee hath ſworne, and ſet his ſeales vnto his vvord, wee are as neere to belieue, as if hee had neuer ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a vvord. So to helpe our beliefe, our vveakeneſſe, and inabilitie that is in vs,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:29"/>for we are ſo vnable by nature, that we can belieue nothing, but that which is of our ſelues; and the more wee leane vnto our ſelues, the further we are from God. I ſay to helpe this wonderfull weakenes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are ready to miſtruſt God in euery word, he hath annexed his Sacraments; &amp; beſides his Sacraments, hee ſweares the things that concerne moſt our ſaluation. As in the Prieſthood of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. He will not ſpeake onely, but he ſweares, and that for our weakenes and infirmities: but yet if he abſtract the miniſtery of his ſpirit, all theſe meanes will do no good.</p>
            <p>Now, the laſt thing is, how the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is peruerted;
<note place="margin">Faults w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> peruert the Sacrament.</note> and how we are defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the fruit, and effect thereof. Two ſorts of faults peruert the Sacrament, and defraude vs of the profit, and vſe thereof: and theſe faults are either in the forme, or in the perſon. In forme, if the eſſentiall forme be ſpoyled, we gette nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when the Sacrament is ſpoyled of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall forme, it is not a Sacrament. There is an eſſentiall forme in Baptiſme, and an eſſentiall form in the Lords Supper, which if they be taken away, ye loſe the vſe of the Sacrament. The eſſentiall forme of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20181:29"/>is: <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt:</hi> leaue out any of theſe three, or doe it in the name of any one of the three perſons one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye loſe the eſſentiall form of Baptiſme. In the Lords Supper, if yee leaue out the leaſt ceremonie, ye loſe the eſſential form, and ſo it is not a Sacrament. I ſpeak of the eſſentiall forme, in reſpect of the Papiſts, who keepe the eſſentiall forme in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, though they haue brought in trifles of their owne, and mixt with it; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they keepe the ſubſtantiall forme, it is not neceſſary, that they, who were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized vnder them, be rebaptized. Indeed, if the vertue of regeneration, flowed from the perſon, it were ſomething; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Chriſt hath this, to giue to whom, &amp; when he pleaſeth, the eſſentiall forme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept, it is not neceſſary that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be reiterated.</p>
            <p>Now, what are the faults in the perſon that peruerts the Sacrament? The fault may be either in the perſon of the giuer, or in the perſon of the receiuer (I ſpeake not of thoſe common faults, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, but of ſuch faultes, as diſable the perſon of the giuer, to be a diſtributer
<pb facs="tcp:20181:30"/>of the Sacrament, &amp; taketh the office from him) ſo when the perſon of the giuer is this way diſabled, no queſtion, it is not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then again in the perſon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, the faults may be, if their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not in the couenant, but out of it, they get not the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Indeed, if the Parents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward com to the couenant, the children (thogh they be gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the couenant) may be receiued. Euen ſo in the L. Supper; if a man be laden with any burthen of ſin, without any purpoſe to repent, hee ought not to receiue it. So then, if ye come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a purpoſe to repent, ye loſe the vſe of the Sacrament: it is onely this purpoſe to repent, that maketh me, who receiue the Sacrament, to get the fruit &amp; effect therof; therefore euery one, who goeth to that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, muſt looke what purpoſe he hath in his hart. Haſt thou a purpoſe to murder, to continue in adultery, or to commit any other vile ſin that is in thy hart, and art not reſolued to repent? In ſhewing thee to be without repentance, thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe to be without faith, and conſequently thou commeſt vnto thy condemnation, &amp; not to thy ſaluation: take heed then what your purpoſe is; for if with a diſſolute life, yee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20181:30"/>haue a diſſolute purpoſe, yee come vnto your euerlaſting perdition.</p>
            <p>I had thought to haue entred particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into the handling of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> but becauſe the time is paſt (and ſome of you I doubt not are to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate) onely this: Remember that yee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe not your ſelues to that Table; except ye finde your harts in ſome ſort prepared. The firſt degree of preparation, ſtandeth in contrition, in ſorowing for ſinne, in a feeling of your ſins, wherein ye haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo gracious a God. If ye be able, as that woman was, by the tears of a contrite hart, to waſh the feete of Chriſt, humbly to kiſs his feete, and to get hold of the foote of Chriſt; though yee dare not preſume ſo high, as to get him whole, ye are in a good caſe: but if thou want all theſe, and haſt them not in ſome meaſure, thou wanteſt all the degrees of preparation; therefore, let none come to this Table, except hee haue theſe in ſome meaſure. But vvhere there is a diſpleaſure for ſinne, a purpoſe to doe better, &amp; an earneſt ſobbing, and ſighing, to get the thing that thou wanteſt; in that ſoule, where God hath placed this deſire of Chriſt, it is the vvorke of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:20181:31"/>ſpirit, &amp; Chriſt will enter there. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though that ſoule be farre from the thing that it ſhould be at, let him not refuſe to goe to the Lords Table; but let him go with a profeſsion of his owne infirmitie &amp; weakeneſſe, and with a deſire of the thing that he wants. Euery one of you that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelfe this way diſpoſed, let him goe in Gods name to the Lords Table: and the Lord worke this in euery one of your harts, that this miniſterie may be effectuall in euery one of you, at this time, and that in the righteous merits of Ieſus Chriſt. To whom, with the Father, &amp; the holy Ghoſt, be all honour, praiſe, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, both now, and for euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">Firſt head generall.</note> we finde ſundry names giuen vnto the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in the booke of God; and euery name carries a ſpeciall reaſon with it.
<note place="margin">Of the names giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto this Sacrament, both in the Bible, and by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> Wee finde this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, called the body, and bloud of Chriſt. This name is giuen vnto it, no doubt, becauſe it is a heauenly, &amp; ſpiritual nouriture; it containes a nouriture of the ſoule, that is able to nouriſh, and traine vp the ſoule, to a life ſpiritual, to that life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: for this cauſe it is called the body, &amp; bloud of Chriſt. It is called alſo the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, to put a difference betwixt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20181:32"/>it, &amp; a profane ſupper: for this is the Lords Supper, a holy ſupper; not a profane, or common ſupper: a ſupper, appointed for the increaſe of holineſs, for the food of the ſoule in holineſs, to feede the ſoule vnto life euerlaſting. Not a ſupper appointed for the belly; for he had ended that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that was appointed for the belly, or euer he began this ſupper, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſoule. A ſupper, no doubt, hauing reſpect to the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance of time, by reaſon it was inſtituted, in the article of that time, when they vſed to ſuppe. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo in the Bible, The Table of the Lord. It is not called the Altar of the Lord: but the Apoſtle calleth it a Table, to ſit at; and not an Altar, to ſtand at: a Table, to take, and receiue at; &amp; not an Altar, to offer at. It is called alſo, the Communion, and participation of the body, and bloud of Chriſt: we haue theſe names giuen vnto it, beſide ſome others, in the Scriptures of God. The Ancients of the Latine, &amp; of the Greeke Churches, gaue it ſundry names, for ſundry reſpects. They called it, a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique action; and this vvas a very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name. Some-times they called it a Thankſgiuing. Some-times they called it
<pb facs="tcp:20181:33"/>a banquet of loue; and ſometimes they gaue it one name, and ſometimes another. And at the laſt, in the declining eſtate of the Latine Church, &amp; in the falling eſtate of the Romane Church, this Sacrament began to be peruerted; and with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, there came in a peruerſe name, and they called it the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> They trouble themſelues much, concerning the deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this name: ſometime they ſeeke it from an Hebrew original; ſometime from a Greeke; and ſometime from a Latine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall: but it is plaine, that the vvord is deriued from the Latine; and it is a word which might haue been tollerable, when it was firſt inſtituted: for, no doubt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, at the firſt inſtitution of this word, was not then wholly peruerted; but now, in proceſſe of time, corruption hath preuatied ſo farre, that it hath turned the Sacrament into a ſacrifice; and where we ſhould take from the hand of GOD, in Chriſt, they make vs to giue.</p>
            <p>This is plaine Idolatry: and therefore, vvhereas the vvord vvas tollerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now it ought not to be tollerable any way, it ought not to be ſuffered. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if wee had eaten, and drunke, as oft
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20181:33"/>the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt in our ſoules, as wee haue eaten that bread, and drunke that wine, which are the ſignes of his body and bloud, we would not haue ſuffered this word of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> much leſſe the very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, to be ſo riſe in this Countrey: But becauſe we haue but played the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaits, and defrauded our ſoules of the body, and bloud of Chriſt, and tooke one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the outward Sacrament; therefore it is that our zeale decayeth; therfore it is, that our knowledge, and light decayeth: and for want of zeale, loue, and knowledge, the word of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> is becom cuſtomable vnto you, and not onely the word, but the very action. I will not runne out heerin: I onely tell you, what commeth of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the hearing of the vvord, vvhat iudgements follow vpon the abuſe of the receiuing of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d head generall. Of the ends why this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was inſtituted.</note> I come to the ends wherefore the Sacrament was appointed. This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inſtituted in the ſignes of Bread, and Wine; and was appointed chiefely for this end, to repreſent our ſpirituall nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the full and perfect nouriture of our ſoules: that as he who hath Bread &amp; Wine, lacketh nothing for the full nouriſhment
<pb facs="tcp:20181:34"/>of his body: ſo hee, or that ſoule vvhich hath the participation of the body, and bloud of Chriſt, wanteth nothing for the full and perfect nouriſhment of the ſoule. To repreſent this full and perfect nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſignes of bread and vvine in the Sacrament, were ſet downe and inſtituted. The ſecond end,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wherfore this Sacrament was inſtituted, is this; That we might teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the world, and to the Princes of the world, who are enemies to our profeſsion; that we might openly avow, and teſtifie vnto them our Religion, and our manner of worſhipping, in the which we avow, and worſhip Chriſt: and that wee might alſo teſtifie our loue towards his members, our bretheren: this is the ſecond end vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was inſtituted.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third end, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was inſtituted, is this; to ſerue for our ſpeciall comfort, and conſolation; to ſerue as a ſoueraine medicine, for all our ſpirituall diſeaſes, as wee finde our ſelues, either readie to fall, or prouoked to fall, by the diuell, the fleſh, or the world; or after that we haue fallen, and are put to flight by the diuell, and would faine flee away from God; GOD of his mercie, and of his infinite pitie, and bottomleſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20181:34"/>compaſsion, hath ſet vp this Sacrament, as a ſigne on an high hill, whereby it may be ſeene on euery ſide, farre, and neere, to call all them againe, that haue run ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully away: and hee clucks to them, as a Henne doth to her chickens, to gather them vnder the wings of his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The fourth end, vvherefore this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was inſtituted, is this, that in this action, wee might thanke him for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, and render to him hartie thanks, that he hath come downe ſo familiarly to vs, bowed the heauens, as it were and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs the body and bloud of his owne Sonne, that wee might render vnto him harty thanks, and ſo ſanctifie his benefits vnto vs: for this thankſgiuing, this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was alſo inſtituted. Thus far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ends briefely.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">Third head generall.</note> I come to the things contayned in this Sacrament. Yee ſee with your eyes, there are corporall things, viſible things, as the Bread, and Wine. There are againe hid from the eye of your body, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the eye of your minde, ſpirituall things, heauenly, and invvard things: both theſe are in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The corporal, viſible, &amp; outward things,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:35"/>are the things which are appointed,
<note place="margin">Of the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſundry heads are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.</note> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſpirituall, heauenly, and inward things. And why? Nothing without a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Theſe corporall ſignes, are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſignifie the ſpirituall things, becauſe we are corporall, we are earthly bodies, we haue our ſoule lodging within a carnal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in a tabernacle of clay, a groſſe taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which cannot be wakened, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, except by the things that are like to it ſelfe. It cannot be induced to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of heauenly things, except by groſs, temporall, and corporall things. If we had been of the nature of the thing ſignified, that as the thing ſignified, is ſpirituall, and heauenly; ſo wee had been ſpirituall, and heauenly, we had not needed a corporall thing: ſo, if the thing ſignified, had been as wee are, corporall, earthly, and viſible, we had not needed a ſigne, to lead vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it: But becauſe the thing ſignified, is ſpirituall, and we are corporall, therfore to bring vs vnto the ſight of theſe ſpirituall things, he vſeth a corporall means, and an outward ſigne. This is the reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe corporall ſignes, are appointed to ſignifie the ſpirituall thing.</p>
            <p>The ſpirituall thing in both the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20181:35"/>is one, and the ſelfe ſame, Chriſt Ieſus, ſignified in both the Sacraments: yet in diuerſe reſpects, he is the thing ſignified in Baptiſme, and hee is the thing ſignified in the Lords Supper. This Chriſt Ieſus, in his bloud chiefely, is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament of Baptiſme: and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that by his bloud, hee waſheth away the filth of our ſoules; becauſe, that by the vertue of his bloud, he quickneth vs in our ſoules, with a heauenly life: becauſe, that by the power of his bloud, hee ingrafteth, and incorporateth vs, in his owne body. For, that Sacrament, is a teſtimonie of the remiſsion of our ſinnes: that is, of the cleaneneſſe of our conſciences, that our conſciences, by that bloud, are waſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. It teſtifieth alſo, our new birth, that wee are begotten ſpiritually, to a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly life. It teſtifieth alſo, the ioyning of vs in the body of Chriſt. As it is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſo it is a ſeale: it not onely teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but ſealeth it vp in our harts, and maketh vs in our harts, to feele the taſte of that heauenly life begun in vs, that wee are tranſlated from death, in the which wee were conceiued, and ingrafted in the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:36"/>
            <p>Marke then: Chriſt, in his bloud, as hee is the waſhing of our regeneration, is the thing ſignified in Baptiſme. In this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, againe, this ſame Chriſt is the thing ſignified, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect; to wit, in this reſpect, that his body and bloud, ſerue to nouriſh my ſoule to life euerlaſting: for this Sacrament, is no other thing, but the image of our ſpirituall nouriſhment; GOD teſtifying how our foules are fed, &amp; nouriſhed to that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, by the image of a corporal nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. So in diuerſe reſpects, the ſame thing, that is, Chr. Ieſus, is ſignified in Baptiſme, and is ſignified in the Lords Supper. In this Sacrament, the fruits of Chriſtes death, whereof I ſpake, the vertue of his ſacrifice, the vertue of his paſsion, I call not theſe fruits &amp; vertues only, the thing ſignified in the Sacrament of the L Supper: but rather I call the thing ſignified, that ſubſtance, &amp; that perſon, out of the which ſubſtance, this vertue, &amp; theſe fruits do flow, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. I grant, and it is moſt certain, that by the lawfull vſe, &amp; participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, thou art partaker of all theſe fruites: yet theſe fruites, are not the firſt, and chiefe thing, whereof thou art parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20181:36"/>in this Sacrament; but of force, thou muſt get another thing firſt. It is true, that no man can be partaker of the ſubſtance of Chriſt, but the ſame ſoule, muſt be alſo partaker of the fruites that flowe from his ſubſtance: yet notwithſtanding, thou muſt diſcerne betwixt the ſubſtance, and the fruites that flowe from the ſubſtance; and thou muſt be partaker of the ſubſtance in the firſt roome; then in the next place, thou muſt bee partaker of the fruites that flowe from his ſubſtance. To make this cleere; in Baptiſme, the fruites of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, are remiſsion of our ſinnes, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the killing of ſinne, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp of our adoption, to life euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The ſubſtance out of the which theſe fruite, doe flowe, is the bloud of Chriſt. Ye muſt heere, of force, diſcerne between the bloud, vvhich is the ſubſtance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene remiſsion of ſinnes, waſhing, and regeneration, which are the fruites, that flow from this bloud: ſo in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the fruits of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, are, the growth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> faith, &amp; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in holineſs. The thing ſignified, is, the ſubſtance; that is, the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt is the ſubſtance, out of which, this
<pb facs="tcp:20181:37"/>growth in faith, and holineſſe, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Now, ſee ye not this; That you muſt diſcerne betweene the ſubſtance, and the fruites, and muſt place the ſubſtance in the firſt place? So that the ſubſtance of Chriſt, that is, Chriſt himſelfe, is the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this Sacrament. For your owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will make this plaine vnto you: Before your ſtomack be filled with any foode, yee muſt eate the ſubſtance of the food firſt; before you be filled with bread, yee muſt eate the ſubſtance of the bread firſt; before your drouth bee quenched with any drinke, yee muſt of neceſsitie, drinke the ſubſtance of the drinke firſt: Euen ſo, after this maner; before the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of your ſoules be ſatisfied &amp; the thirſt thereof quenched, yee muſt eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his bloud firſt, and that by faith. So, conſider the one by the other; looke to what vſe bread and vvine ſerue to thy body, to the ſame vſe, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Chriſt ſerue to thy ſoule; and he that appointed the one to ſerue for thy body, the ſame God appointed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſerue for thy ſoule. So, looke how impoſsible it is for thee, to be fedde with that foode that neuer commeth into thy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20181:37"/>mouth, or to recouer health, by thoſe drugges which neuer were applyed; it is as impoſsible, for thee to be fed by the body of Chriſt, &amp; to get thy health by the bloud of Chriſt, except thou firſt eate his bodie, and drinke his bloud. Then yee ſee, that the thing ſignified in the Lords Supper, is not the fruites, ſo much as the body, and bloud, and Chriſt Ieſus, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and ſubſtance, from which theſe fruites doe flowe, and proceed.</p>
            <p>Then I ſay, ſuppoſe Chriſt,
<note place="margin">The thing ſignified in both the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, is one: the ſignes are not one.</note> who is the thing ſignified, remaine alwaies one, and the ſame, in both the Sacraments: yet the ſignes, whereby this one Chriſt is ſignified in the Sacraments, are not one, nor of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quall number. For in Baptiſme, the thing that repreſenteth Chriſt, is Water. In the Lords Supper, the things that repreſent Chriſt, are Bread, and Wine. Water is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to repreſent Chriſt in Baptiſme, becauſe it is meeteſt to repreſent our vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing with the bloud of Chriſt: for, what is fitter to waſh with, then water? ſo there is nothing meeter to waſh the ſoule, then the bloud of Chriſt. In this Sacrament he hath appointed Bread, and Wine: why? Becauſe there is nothing more meet to
<pb facs="tcp:20181:38"/>nouriſh the body, then bread and vvine, ſo the Lord hath not choſen theſe ſignes without a reaſon. As the ſignes in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament are not alwaies one; ſo the ſame in both, are not of one number: for, in Baptiſme, wee haue but one element; in this Sacrament, wee haue two elements. Now, what is the reaſon of this diuerſitie, that the Lord in the one Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Why in Baptiſme there is but one ſigne, and in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per two.</note> hath appointed two ſignes, and in the other but one ſigne? I will ſhew you the reaſon. He hath appointed onely one ſigne in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, to wit, Water; becauſe Water is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient enough for the whole. If Water had not been ſufficient, to repreſent the thing ſignified, hee would haue appointed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſigne: but in reſpect that water do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the turne, and repreſenteth fully the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of our ſoules, by the bloud of Chriſt, what need then haue we of any other ſign? Now, in this Sacrament, one ſigne will not ſuffice, but there muſt be two. And vvhy? Wine cannot be ſufficient alone; neyther can Bread be ſufficient alone: for, he that hath Bread onely, and Wine onely, hath not a perfect corporall nouriſhment; therefore, that they might repreſent, and let vs ſee a perfect nouriſhment, hee hath
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20181:38"/>giuen vs both Bread &amp; Wine (for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect corporall nouriſhment, ſtandeth in meat and drinke) to repreſent the full and perfect nouriſhment of the ſoule. Marke how full, and perfect a nouriſhment hee hath to his body, that hath ſtore of Bread and Wine: So he that hath Chriſt, lacketh nothing of a full, and perfect nouriſhment for his ſoule. Then you ſee the reaſon, wherfore there are two ſignes appointed in this Sacrament, and onely one ſigne in Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>There remaineth yet, concerning theſe ſignes, two things to be inquired. Firſt,
<note place="margin">Two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: What pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the bread hath to be a ſigne in this Sacrament: And how long that power indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</note> what power hath that bread in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be a ſigne, more then the bread, which is vſed in common houſes: from whence commeth that power? Next, if it haue a power, how long indureth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that power, with the bread? For the firſt, concerning the power which that bread hath, more then any other bread: I will tell you.</p>
            <p>That bread hath a power giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto it by Chriſt, &amp; by his inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>1</label> by the which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it is appointed to ſignifie his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to repreſent his body, &amp; to deliuer his body. That bread, hath a power flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:20181:39"/>Chriſt,
<note place="margin">That bread hath that power from Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</note> and his inſtitution, vvhich other common bread hath not: ſo that if any of you would ask, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Miniſter, in this action, is breaking, or diſtributing that Bread, pouring out, and diſtributing that Wine; if you would, I ſay, aske, what ſort of creatures thoſe are? this is the anſwere: They are holy things. Yee muſt giue this name, to the ſignes, and ſeales of the body and bloud of Chriſt. That bread of the Sacrament, is a holy bread; and that vvine, is an holy vvine: Why? Becauſe the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inſtitution of Chriſt, hath ſeuerd them from that vſe wherevnto they ſerued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and hath applied them vnto an holy vſe; not to feed the body, but to feede the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Thus farre concerning the power of that bread: it hath a power flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, and his inſtitution.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>2</label> Now, the ſecond thing is, how long this power continueth vvith that bread; how long that bread hath this office.
<note place="margin">That power continues during the ſeruice of the Table.</note> In a word, I ſay, this power conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth with that bread, during the time of the action; during the ſeruice of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Look how long that action continues, and that the ſeruice of the Table laſteth, ſo long it continueth holy bread; ſo long
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20181:39"/>continueth the power with that bread: but, looke how ſoone the action is ended, ſo ſoone endeth the holineſſe of it: looke how ſoon the ſeruice of the Table is ended; ſo ſoon that bread, becomes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread againe, &amp; the holineſſe of it, ceaſeth. Then this power continueth not for euer, but it continues onely, during the time of the action, and ſeruice of the Table. Thus far concerning the Elements.</p>
            <p>There is beſides the Elements, an other ſort of ſignes in the Sacrament: there is not a ceremonie in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, but is a ſigne, and hath it owne ſpirituall ſignification with it: as namely, looking to the breaking of that bread, it repreſenteth vnto thee, the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the body, &amp; bloud of Chriſt. Not, that his body, and bones were broken, but that it was broken with dolour, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and diſtreſſe of hart; with the weight of the indignation, and furie of God, that he ſuſtained for our ſinnes, which he took vpon him. Then, the breaking, is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall ceremonie: the pouring out of the wine alſo, is an eſſentiall ceremonie. For, as yee ſee cleerly, that by the wine is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the bloud of Chriſt; ſo, by the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:20181:40"/>out of the wine, is ſignified, that his bloud was ſeuered from his fleſh; and the ſeuering of thoſe two, maketh death: for, in bloud is the life; and conſequently, it teſtifieth his death. The pouring out of the wine, then, tells thee, that he dyed for thee, that his bloud was ſhed for thee; ſo this is an eſſentiall ceremonie, which muſt not be left out. Likewiſe, the diſtribution, giuing, and eating of that bread, are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ceremonies. And what doth the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting teſtifie vnto thee? The applying of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt vnto thy ſoule. So that there is none of theſe rites, but haue their own ſignification; and there cannot one of them be left out, but ye ſhal peruert the whole action. Thus farre concerning the ſignes.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">An obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> what profit can ye make of all this diſcourſe? Learne this leſſon, and yee ſhal make profit by theſe things. In reſpect that euery ſigne and ceremonie, hath it owne ſpirituall ſignification, ſo that there is not a ceremonie in this whole action, that wants it owne ſpirituall ſignification; conſider this, and thinke with your ſelues, at that time eſpecially when yee are at the Lords Table, &amp; in the ſight of that action,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20181:40"/>that looke vvhat thou ſeeſt the Miniſter dooing outwardly, what euer it be: (Is he breaking that Bread? is hee dealing that bread? is he pouring out, and diſtributing that vvine?) Thinke aſſuredly vvith thy ſelfe, that Chriſt is as buſie, dooing all theſe things, ſpiritually vnto thy ſoule: hee is as buſie, giuing vnto thee, his ovvne bodie, vvith his owne hand: hee is as buſie, giuing to thee his owne bloud, with the vertue, and efficacie of it. So, in this action (if thou be a faithfull Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant) looke vvhat the mouth doth, and hovv the mouth of the body is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied outwardlie: ſo is the hand, and mouth of the ſoule (vvhich is faith) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied invvardly. As the mouth taketh that Bread, and that Wine; ſo the mouth of thy ſoule, taketh the body, and bloud of Chriſt, and that by faith. For by faith, and a conſtant perſwaſion, is the onelie vvay to eate the bodie, and drinke the bloud of Chriſt invvardly: and dooing this, there cannot but follow a fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eating. Thus farre, for the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſignes.</p>
            <p>Now commeth in the matter wherein greateſt difficulty ſtandeth, wherof I ſpake
<pb facs="tcp:20181:41"/>the laſt day,
<note place="margin">How the ſignes, and the thing ſignified, are conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Sacrament.</note> as God gaue me the grace; yet in the particular, I muſt ſpeak, as wel as in the generall, but ſomewhat more ſhortly. Then ye haue to vnderſtand, for the better information of your conſciences; and for the better preparation of your ſoules, yee haue to vnderſtand, how that bread, and that vvine, which are the ſignes, are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with the body, and bloud of Chriſt, which are ſignified thereby: What ſort of coniunction this is, and from whence this coniunction floweth, I ſhall be briefe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue already, in my laſt Lecture, ſpoken of it at large.</p>
            <p>Take heede: for if ye giue not good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, it is not poſsible, that ye can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this coniunction. Concerning this coniunction, would you knowe how theſe two are coupled? Then muſt you firſt marke the nature of the ſignes, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing ſignified; yee muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue both their natures: And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing can be coupled, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with other, but ſo farre, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it will ſuffer; if the nature of it will not ſuffer a coniunction, they cannot be conioyned: or, will the nature of it ſuffer a coniunction? looke how farre it will ſuffer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20181:41"/>a coniunction, ſo farre are they conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Seeing then ye muſt obſerue the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things that are conioyned, firſt marke the thing ſignified, what the nature thereof is; marking that, ye ſhall ſee, that the thing ſignified, is of a ſpirituall nature; of a heauenly, and myſticall nature: then may ye conclude, that this ſpiritual thing, will ſuffer a ſpirituall coniunction, a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, and ſecret coniunction.</p>
            <p>Againe, obſerue the ſigne: The ſigne, of his nature (as I haue told you) hath a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto the thing ſignified; &amp; the thing ſignified, of his nature, hath a relation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſigne. So then the ſigne, &amp; the thing ſignified, will ſuffer to be conioyned, by a mutuall relation: both the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, in reſpect they haue a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall relation, the one vnto the other, they will ſuffer themſelues to be conioyned by a relatiue coniunction. Now if ye ask me, what ſort of coniunction, is betweene that bread, and that wine, and the body, and bloud of Chriſt: To tell you in a word, I ſay, it is a ſecret, and ſpirituall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſuch a coniunction, as ſtandeth in a mutuall reſpect, betwixt the bread, and the body of Chriſt, and betwixt the wine, and
<pb facs="tcp:20181:42"/>the bloud of Chriſt: then I ſay, it is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, &amp; a ſpirituall coniunction. Ye would not be ſo inquiſitiue of this coniunction, if it were corporall, viſible, or locall: if you ſaw them both before your eyes, you would not aske how they are conioyned; or if thou didſt ſee them both in one place. But, becauſe you ſee but the one with your eyes, and the other is hid, this maketh the coniunction the more difficult to be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and vnderſtood. And how is it poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ye can conceiue this ſecret, and hid coniunction, except you haue the eyes of your minde illuminated by the ſpirit, whereby ye may come to the right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? But if yee haue any inſight into theſe ſpirituall matters that come by faith, this coniunction will appeare as cleerely, by the eye of your faith, as the phyſicall coniunction dooth, to the eye of your body.</p>
            <p>Novv, to haue this matter made more plain; there is another coniunction, which ſerueth to make this coniunction very cleere: namely, the coniunction betwixt the vvord, which I ſpeake, and the thing ſignified by that ſame word. As if I ſpeake to you, of things in this language, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20181:42"/>yee vnderſtand, bee it of things paſt, though neuer ſo long ſince; of things to come, though neuer ſo far off; of things abſent, though neuer ſo farre diſtant; yet ſo ſoone as I ſpeake the vvord, vvhether it be of things paſt, or to come, the thing it ſelfe will come into your minde. The vvord is heard no ſooner by your eare, but the thing ſignified by the ſame vvord, commeth into your minde. What maketh the thing ſignified, though abſent, to come into my mind? This could not be, except there were a coniunction, betweene the word, and the thing ſignified by the word.</p>
            <p>As for example; If I ſpeak of the King, who is now a great way diſtant from vs (I pray God bleſſe him) yee will no ſooner heare the word, but the King, vvho is the thing ſignified by the word, will come into your minde. If I ſpeake of things paſt, though they be already expired, yet the thing ſignified, vvill preſently come into your minde: ſo there is a coniunction yee ſee, between the word, and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the word. Marke this coniunction, and yee ſhall gette the nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, and coupling of the ſigne, which is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:43"/>
            <p>For obſerue, what ſort of coniunction is between the vvord, and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the word, the ſame ſort of coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is between the Sacrament, which is ſeene to the eye of your body, &amp; the thing ſignified by the Sacrament, which is ſeene to the eye of your ſoule onely. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; ſo ſoone as thou ſeeſt that bread, taken in the hand of the Miniſter, thou ſeeſt it not ſo ſoone, but incontinent, the body of Chriſt muſt come into thy mind; theſe two are ſo conioyned, that they com both together: the one, to the outward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the other, to the inward ſenſes. This is not enough now, becauſe in the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ye are commanded to goe further; &amp; not onely to looke to that bread, and that wine, but to take that bread, and that wine: incontinent, as your hand takes the one, ſo your hart takes the other; as your teeth eates the one, ſo the teeth of your ſoule, which is faith, eates the other; that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth Chriſt vnto your ſoule. So yee ſee there is a coniunction heere, ſecret, and myſticall: and therefore, Chriſt cannot be conioyned, but by a ſecret, and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call coniunction. The coniunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt, and vs, is a ſecret, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20181:43"/>coniunction; which the Apoſtle, in the fift of the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> calleth that ſpirituall coniunction, ful of an high myſterie: this coniunction cannot be taken vp at the firſt. So, ſeeing the coniunction is ſecret, and ſpirituall, and not perceiued, but by the ſpirit of God; all is as nothing, except ye haue ſome portion, and meaſure of his ſpirit. All that is taught in the word, and Sacraments, will neuer doe you good, will neuer carry your ſoules to heauen, except the ſpirit of God illuminate your mindes, and make you to finde in your ſoules, the thing that ye hear in the word. Then learn this, ſeeing the word ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be vnderſtood, but by the ſpirit of GOD, craue that the Lord would illuminate the eyes of your mindes, by his ſpirit; and be you as careful to get the ſpirit, as yee are carefull now in the hearing of the word. Thus farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the coniunction.</p>
            <p>Now ye haue heard, how the ſigne is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with the thing ſignified, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for you to knowe? This reſts yet to knowe, how the ſigne is receiued,
<note place="margin">How the ſigne, &amp; the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</note> and how the thing ſignified is receiued; vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee both receiued with one mouth, or not; whether the ſigne, and the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:44"/>thing ſignified, be receiued after one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and manner, or not. And marking the diuerſe manner of receiuing, and the diuerſity of the inſtruments, yee ſhall not eaſily erre in the Sacrament. The ſigne, and the thing ſignified, are receiued by two mouthes: for ye ſee the ſignes, that is, that bread, and wine, wherunto they are giuen; they are giuen to the mouth of the body. Then the mouth of the body, is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that receiueth that bread, and that vvine, which are the ſignes. As that bread, and that wine, are viſible, and corporall: ſo the mouth, and inſtrument, whereby they are receiued, is viſible, and corporall. The thing ſignified by the bread, and wine, is not receiued by the mouth of the body: no, the Scripture denieth that plainly, but it is receiued by the mouth of the ſoule. Then there are two mouthes: that bread, and that wine, which are the ſignes, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the mouth of the body: Chriſt, vvho is the thing ſignified, is receiued by the mouth of the ſoule; that is, by a true faith.</p>
            <p>Then, bring not to the Lords Table, one mouth onely (for, if yee bring the mouth of your body onely, it auaileth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20181:44"/>nothing) but bring with you alſo, the mouth of your ſoule, a conſtant perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the death of Chriſt, for that is availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Novv, concerning the manner hovv the ſignes are receiued, and the manner how the thing ſignified is receiued; yee may eaſily knowe, that theſe corporall, &amp; naturall ſignes, muſt be receiued after a corporall, and naturall maner: they muſt be taken with the hand, or mouth of the body. Againe, a ſupernaturall thing, muſt be receiued after a ſupernaturall manner: A ſpirituall thing, muſt be receiued, after a ſpirituall manner. So, as the ſignes are corporall, and receiued after a corporall manner, with the hand, or the mouth of the body; In like manner, the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is ſpirituall, and receiued after a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manner, with the hand and mouth of the ſoule, which is true faith. Thus yee haue briefely deliuered vnto you, the whole preparation, that is neceſſary for the vnderſtanding of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now, what doctrine gather I from this? Of this laſt point, vvhere I ſay, that Chriſt is the thing ſignified, and cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but by faith, cannot be receiued,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:45"/>nor digeſted, but by a faithfull ſoule: what kinde of receiuing confirme I in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? I eſtabliſh no kind of receiuing of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">What kinde of receiuing Chriſt, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> but a ſpiritual receiuing: he can not be perceiued, nor receiued, but by faith, and faith is ſpirituall: Therefore in this Sacrament, I eſtabliſh onely a ſpiritual taking of Chriſt; &amp; not a carnall, or fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiuing. This is the ground: Novv let vs ſee, what inconuenience can follow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground.
<note place="margin">Inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences caſt in by the Papiſts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The Papiſts ſay, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, this inconuenience ſhall follow. If there be no receiuing of Chriſt, but a ſpirituall receiuing, then (ſay they) your Sacrament is in vaine; this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, was inſtituted to no end. And what is their reaſon? If there be no way to receiue Chriſt (ſay the Papiſts) but by faith, what need you then a Sacrament? Yee receiue Chriſt, by faith, in the word: by the naked and ſimple prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, ye get faith. So the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple word, may ſerue the turne. What need haue ye of a Sacrament, if ye get not ſome new thing in the Sacrament, which yee could not get in the word?</p>
            <p>This is their Argument; whereof ye ſee their concluſion to be this: Wee get no
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20181:45"/>other new thing in the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Firſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience: That the Sacrament is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> then we doe in the vvord, if there be no receiuing but ſpirituall. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Sacrament is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</p>
            <p>VVee admit the Antecedent to bee true: vvee get no other thing, nor no new thing in the Sacrament, but the ſame thing which we got in the word. I would haue thee deuiſe, and imagine vvith thy ſelfe, what new thing thou vvouldeſt haue: let the hart of man, deuiſe, imagine, and wiſh, he durſt neuer haue thought to haue ſuch a thing, as the Sonne of GOD; hee durſt neuer haue preſumed, to haue pearced the clowdes, to haue aſcended ſo high, as to haue craued the Sonne of GOD in his fleſh, to be the foode of his ſoule. Hauing the Sonne of God, thou haſt him, who is the heire of all things; who is King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and earth; and in him, thou haſt all things. What more then canſt thou wiſh? What better thing canſt thou wiſh? Hee is equall with the Father, one in ſubſtance with the Father, true GOD, &amp; true man, vvhat more canſt thou wiſh? Then, I ſay, vvee get no other thing in the Sacrament, then wee had in the vvord: content thee vvith this. But ſuppoſe it be ſo; yet the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:46"/>Sacrament is not ſuperfluous. But woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou vnderſtand what new thing thou obtaineſt? what other thing thou getteſt? I will tell thee.
<note place="margin">Refutation of the firſt Inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> Suppoſe thou get that ſame thing which thou haddeſt in the vvord, yet thou getteſt that ſame thing better. What is that <hi>better?</hi> Thou obtaineſt a greater, and ſurer hold of that ſame thing in the Sacrament, then thou hadſt by the hearing of the vvord. That ſame thing, which thou poſſeſſedſt, by the hearing of the word, thou dooſt poſſeſſe now more largely; it hath larger bounds in thy ſoule, by the receiuing of the Sacrament, then other-wiſe it could haue, by the hearing of the word onely. Then wilt thou aske what new thing wee get? I ſay, wee get this new thing: we get Chriſt, better then before; we get the thing which we had, more fully: that is, with a ſurer apprehenſion then we had it before; we gette a greater hold of Chriſt now. For, by the Sacrament, my faith is nouriſhed, the boundes of my ſoule are enlarged: and ſo, whereas I had but a little hold of Chriſt before, as it were betweene my finger, and my thumbe, now I get him in my whole hand; and ſtill the more that my faith groweth, the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20181:46"/>better hold I get of Chriſt Ieſus. So the Sacrament is very neceſſary, and if it were no more but to get Chriſt better, and to get a faſter apprehenſion of him, by the Sacrament, then vvee could haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Now, if it were true, that the Sacrament is ſuperfluous: by the ſame reaſon it ſhold follow alſo, that the repetition of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is ſuperfluous. For, when yee come to the Sacrament the ſecond time, ye get no other thing then yee did the firſt time: vvhen ye come vnto the Sacrament the third time, yet get no other thing then yee did the firſt time: and yet no man will ſay, that the third, and ſecond comming, is a ſuperfluous thing. And vvhy? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the ſecond comming, my faith is augmented, I vnderſtand better, I growe in knowledge, I growe in apprehenſion, I grow in feeling: and in getting the growth of all theſe, as oft as I come, there is no man will ſay, that the oft comming to the Sacrament is ſuperfluous, &amp; if it were eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day once. So, their firſt inconuenience auailes not: Wee get no new thing in the Sacrament; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sacrament is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:47"/>
            <p>Thus farre for the firſt. Then there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends another thing on the ſame ground. If Chriſt be not perceiued, but by faith; then, ſay we, no wicked body can perceiue him; hee that lacketh faith, cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. He that lacketh faith, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Sacrament, of that bread, and that vvine, and may eate of that bread, and drinke of that wine; but hee that vvanteth faith, may not eate &amp; drink of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, ſignified by that bread, &amp; by that wine. So this is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe people can perceiue Chriſt, nor eate the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Againſt this ground, they bring their Argument out of the ſame words of the Apoſtle, which I haue read; the words are theſe; <hi>Hee that eateth of this Bread, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorthily</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and drinketh of this Cuppe vnworthily, is guilty of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is their ground:
<note place="margin">Second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience.</note> So that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will ſuffer this forme: <hi>No man can be guiltie of that thing, vvhich hee hath not receiued: they haue not receiued the body, and bloud of Chriſt: therefore, they cannot be guiltie of the body, and bloud of Chriſt: but ſo it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, they are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20181:47"/>guilty, therefore they haue receiued the body, and bloud of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwere vnto the Propoſition,
<note place="margin">Refutation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, wher in are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaſons giuen, why the wicked are counted guilty of the body, and bloud of Chriſt.</note> and I ſay, it is very falſe: They could not bee guiltie of that body, and bloud, except they had receiued it; for they may be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that ſame body, &amp; of that ſame bloud, ſuppoſe they neuer receiued it. But marke the Text: The Text ſaith not, that they eate the body of Chriſt vnworthily; but it ſaith, that they eate that bread, and drinke that wine vnworthily: And yet, becauſe they eate that bread, and drinke that wine vnworthily, they are counted before God, guiltie of the body, and bloud of Chriſt. Now wherefore is this? Not becauſe they receiue him; for, if they receiued him, they could not but receiue him vvorthily, for Chriſt cannot be receiued of any man, but woorthily: but they are accounted guiltie of the body and bloud of the Son of GOD, becauſe they refuſed him. For vvhen they did eate that Bread, and drink that wine, they might, if they had had faith, haue eaten and drunke the fleſh, and bloud of Chriſt leſus. Now, becauſe thou refuſeſt the body of Chriſt, offered to thee, thou contemneſt his body, offered vnto
<pb facs="tcp:20181:48"/>thee, if thou haue not an eye to diſcerne, and indge of this body, that is offered. For if they had had faith they might haue ſeen his body, offered with the bread; by faith they might haue taken that ſame body, &amp; by faith, they might haue eaten that ſame body. Therefore, lacking their wedding garment, wanting faith, whereby they ſhould eate the bodie, and drink the bloud of Chriſt; wanting faith, which is the eye of the ſoule, to perceiue, and the mouth of the ſoule, to receiue that body, which is ſpirituallie offered; they are counted guiltie of that ſame body &amp; bloud.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs make this more cleere by a ſimilitude. Ye ſee among worldly Princes, their cuſtome is, not to ſuffer their maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to be impeached in the ſmalleſt thing that they haue. VVhat meaner thing is there that concerneth the maieſtie of a Prince, then a ſeale? for the ſubſtance of it is but wax: yet, if thou diſdainfullie vſe that ſeale, and contemne it, and ſtampe it vnder thy feet, thou ſhalt be eſteemed as guilty of his body, and bloud, as hee that laid violent hands on him, &amp; thou ſhalt be puniſhed accordingly. Much more, if thou come as a ſwine, or as a dog, to handle the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20181:48"/>ſeales of the bodie, and bloud of Chriſt; much more maieſt thou bee rockoned guilty of his body, and of his bloud.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of the eating of the body of Chriſt: The vvicked cannot eate the bodie of Chriſt; but they may bee guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it. The Apoſtle maketh this more plaine yet, by another ſpeech, vvhich I haue ſometimes handled out of this place. In <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.6. it is ſaid, that <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> they that fall away, they crucifie the Son of God againe; and their falling away, maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as guilty, as they were who crucified him. He is now in heauen, they cannot fetch him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, to crucify him: yet the Apoſtle ſaith, they crucifie him. Why? Becauſe their malice is as great, as theirs that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, becauſe they match in malice, with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that crucified him; ſo that if they had him on the earth, they vvould doe the like: therefore they are ſaid to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Sonne of GOD. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. there is another ſpeech: the wicked are ſaid to ſtampe the bloud of Chriſt vnder their feet. Why? Becauſe their malice is as great, as theirs that ſtamped his bloud.</p>
            <p>Now, they are accounted for this reaſon, to be guiltie of the bodie and bloud of
<pb facs="tcp:20181:49"/>Chriſt, not becauſe they eate his body, but becauſe they refuſed it, vvhen they might haue had it.</p>
            <p>Now, the time remaines yet, wherein we may haue the body,
<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and bloud of Chriſt. This time is very precious, and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of times is very ſecret, and hath it owne bounds: if yee take not this time now, it will away. This time of Grace, and of that heauenly foode, hath been diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto you very long: but how ye haue profited, your liues and behauiours teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Remember therefore your ſelues in time, and in time make vſe of it; for yee knowe not how long it will laſt: craue a mouth to receiue, as well the food of your ſoules, that is offered, as ye doe the food of your bodies: and take this time while yee may haue it, or aſſuredly the time ſhall come, when yee ſhall cry for it, but ſhall not get it; but in place of Grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ſhall come iudgement, vengeance, &amp; the diſpenſation of vvrath.</p>
            <p>They will not leaue this matter ſo; but they inſiſt yet, and they bring more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to prooue, that the vvicked are partakers of the bodie,
<note place="margin">Third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience.</note> and bloud of Chriſt; <hi>That Bread</hi> (ſay they) <hi>yee vvill
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20181:49"/>grant, vvhich the vvicked man eates, is not naked bread, but is that bread vvhich is the Sacrament.</hi> Thus then they make their Argument; <hi>The Sacrament hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conioyned vvith it, the thing ſignified: But the Sacrament is giuen to all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thing ſignified is giuen to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if I grant to them all this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<note place="margin">Refutation of the third inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> There ſhould no inconuenience follow. For, the thing ſignified may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all; that is, offered to all, as it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to all men, and yet not receiued of all. Giuen to all; therefore receiued of all, it followeth not. I may offer you tvvo things; yet it is in your owne will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will take them, or no, but ye may take the one, and refuſe the other: and yet hee that offers, offered you the thing that ye refuſed, as truely, as the thing which ye tooke. So, GOD deceiueth no man: but with the word, and Sacraments, aſſuredly hee giueth two things, if they would take them. By his vvord, hee offers the word to the eare, hee offers Chriſt Ieſus to the ſoule. By his Sacraments, hee offers the Sacraments to the eye, hee offers Chriſt Ieſus to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Now, it may be, that where two things
<pb facs="tcp:20181:50"/>are truly, &amp; conioyntlie offred, a man may receiue the one, and refuſe the other. Hee receiueth the one, becauſe he hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to take it: he refuſeth the other, becauſe he wanteth an inſtrument. I heare the word, becauſe I haue an eare to heare it with: I receiue the Sacrament, becauſe I haue a mouth to receiue it with: but as for the thing, which the word, and Sacraments repreſent, I may refuſe it; becauſe I haue not a mouth to take it, nor an eye to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it: and therefore, the fault is not on Gods part, but on our part. The wicked get the body, and bloud of Chriſt offered to them conioyntly, with the word, &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the fault is on their part, that they haue not a mouth to receiue him, and God is not bound to giue them a mouth. Mark this: That if it were not of Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace, and mercie, that he giueth mee an eye to perceiue him, and a mouth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him; I would refuſe him, as well as they. So, this Argument holdeth not: <hi>Chriſt is offered to all; Ergo, hee is receiued of all.</hi> Happy were they, if they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. Thus far for the 3. Argument.</p>
            <p>What reſteth now for the ful vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Sacrament? Theſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20181:50"/>That we vnderſtand the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpeeches, that are vſed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for, we vſe to ſpeake of them: God vſeth to ſpeake of them: and the Ancients vſe to ſpeake of them. Wee vſe to ſay, that the ſoule eateth the body of Chriſt, and drinketh the bloud of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">How the ſoule is ſaid to eate the body, and drinke the bloud of Chriſt.</note> Theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wold be opened to you, how the ſoule is ſaid to eate the body, &amp; drink the bloud of Chriſt: theſe ſpeeches are Sacramental; yet yee are not the wiſer: but I will make it plaine, by Gods grace. They are Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall; what is that? Ye knowe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the bodie to eate and drink, they are the proper actions of the body only. Now they are aſcribed to the ſoule by a tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by a figuratiue maner of ſpeaking. That which is proper to the body, is aſcribed to the ſoule, and it is ſaid that the ſoule eateth &amp; drinketh. The eating of the ſoule, doth reſemble the eating of the bodie: then the eating of the ſoule, is no other thing, but the applying of Chriſt to the ſoule; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that he hath ſhed his bloud for mee; that he hath purchaſed remiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins for me. Wherfore then cal you this an eating? what call you the eating of the body? They body eateth, when thou applieſt the meat
<pb facs="tcp:20181:51"/>to thy mouth. If then the eating of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be no other thing, but the applying of meat to the mouth; the eating of the ſoule is no other thing, but the applying of the nouriſhment to the ſoule. Then yee ſee what is meant by the eating and drinking of the ſoule: no other thing, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Chriſt to my ſoule, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of his death &amp; paſsion to my ſoule; and this is onely done by faith: therefore he that lacketh faith, cannot eate Chriſt. Thus farre for the eating and drinking of the ſoule, vvhich are Sacramentall ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>There remaineth now, of all theſe great things,
<note place="margin">Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and of all this doctrine which hath bin taught, but this one leſſon: That thou learne to apply Chriſt rightly to thy ſoule. Thou art a great Diuine, if thou haſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this wel: for, in the right applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, to the ſick ſoule, to the wounded conſcience, and diſeaſed heart, heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes the fountaine of all our felicitie, &amp; the wel-ſpring of all our ioy. And I wil tell you, what this application worketh: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, what the preſence of thy ſoule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee (ſuppoſe thou want Chriſt in thy ſoule) doth to this earthly body, to this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20181:51"/>lump of clay; as by the preſence of the ſoule, it liueth, it mooueth, it feeleth: as the ſoule giueth to the body, life, mouing, and ſenſes: that ſame very thing, dooth Chriſt vnto thy ſoule. Haſt thou once laid hold of, and applyed him to thee? As the ſoule quickens thy body, ſo hee quickens thy ſoule; not with an earthly, or temporal life, but with the life which hee liueth in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he makes thee to liue that ſame life, which the Angels liue in heauen: hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thee to moue, not with worldly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but with heauenly, ſpirituall, &amp; cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall motions. Againe, he inſpires in thee, not outward ſenſes, but heauenly ſenſes; he worketh in thee, a ſpiritual feeling, that in thine own hart &amp; conſcience, thou mayſt find the effect of this word. So, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of Chriſt with my ſoule, I get a thouſand times greater benefits, then the body doth by the ſoule: for the bodie, by the preſence of the ſoule, getteth onely an earthly &amp; temporall life, ſubiect to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual miſery: but by the preſence of Chriſt in my ſoule, I ſee a bleſſed life, I feele a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed life: &amp; that ſame life, takes daily more &amp; more increaſe in me. Then the ground of all our perfection, &amp; bleſſednes, ſtandeth
<pb facs="tcp:20181:52"/>in this coniunction: &amp; ſuppoſe thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt liue <hi>Methuſhelaes</hi> yeeres, and wert euer ſeking; yet if in the laſt houre, thou get this coniunction, thou maiſt thinke thy trauel well beſtowed; thou haſt gotten enough: for if we haue obtained Chriſt, wee haue gotten all with him. Then the applying of Chriſt to my ſoule, is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of all my ioy &amp; felicitie. Now, let vs ſee how we get this coniunction. This is a ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, a coniunction hard, &amp; difficult to be purchaſed, obtained, &amp; gotten of vs, How then is this coniunction brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout? which are the means of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Gods part? &amp; which are the means on our part to get Chriſt, to put Chriſt in our ſoules, &amp; to make Chriſt one with vs? There is one means on Gods part, that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs vnto Chriſt, &amp; there is another on our part. On Gods part, there is the holie ſpirit, which offereth the body, &amp; bloud of Chr. to vs: and on our part, there muſt be a means, or elſe, though he offer, we will not receiue. Therefore of neceſsity, there muſt be faith in our ſoules, to receiue that which the holy ſpirit offers, to receiue that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food, of the body &amp; bloud of Chr. which ſhe holy ſpirit offers. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, &amp; the holy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20181:52"/>ſpirit, are the two means of this ſpiritual, &amp; heauenly coniunction. By theſe 2. means, by faith, &amp; by the holy ſpirit, I get the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chr. the body of Chr. is mine, &amp; he is giuen to my ſoule. Now, heer comes in the queſtion; How canſt thou ſay, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt is giuen, or deliuered to thee, ſeeing the body of Chriſt is ſitting at the right hand of God the Father? &amp; look how great diſtance is betwixt heauen and earth, as great diſtance is there, betwixt the body of Chriſt, and thy body: how then ſay yee, that the body of Chriſt is giuen to you? The Papiſts vnderſtand not this; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they imagin a groſs &amp; carnal coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Except the ſpirit of God reueale theſe things, they cannot be vnderſtood. The ſpirit of God muſt illuminate our mindes, and be planted in all our harts, before wee can come to the vnderſtanding of this. Then wouldeſt thou vnderſtand hovv Chriſt is giuen thee? This ground is true, that the bodie of Chriſt, is at the right hand of the Father; the bloud of Chriſt is at the right hand of the Father: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, though there be as great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt my body, and the bodie of Chriſt, as is betwixt heauen and earth,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:53"/>yet Chriſtes body is giuen to me, becauſe I haue a title to his body giuen to mee: the right, and title which is giuen to me, of his body, and bloud, makes me to poſſeſſe his body and bloud. The diſtance of the place, hurteth not my title, nor my right: for if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, haue a peece of Land lying in the fartheſt part of England, if ye haue a good title to it, the diſtance of the place cannot hurt your title: ſo I ſay, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place, hurts not my title, and my right, that I haue to Chriſt. But, though he be ſitting at the right hand of the Father, yet the title, and right, that I haue to him, makes him mine; ſo that I may ſay trulie, this Chriſt is my property. Then Chriſt is not made mine, becauſe I fetch him out of the heauens: but he is mine, becauſe I haue a ſure title, &amp; right to him; &amp; hauing a ſure title, and iuſt right to him, the diſtance of place, how farre ſoeuer it be, can no wayes hurt my title, nor right; but where-euer he be, he is mine, becauſe I haue a right &amp; ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to him. Yea, not onely haue I a title to him, but this title is confirmed to mee: For, as I gette a title to him in the vvord (and if I got not that title to him in the word, I durſt not come to the Sacrament)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20181:53"/>ſo in the Sacrament, I get the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my title, I get the Seale, which confirmes my title. Then to come to the point, Chriſts bodie, is ſitting at the right hand of the Father, and yet he is mine, and is deliuered to me, becauſe I haue right to his bodie, be it where it will: hee was borne for mee, giuen to mee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to mee: So diſtance of place, hurts not the ſuretie of my title, as propinquitie of place, helpes not the ſuretie of the ſame. Though Chriſt would bow the heauens, and touch thee with his bodie, as he did <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi> yet this could not helpe thee, for if thou haſt not a title to him, thou dareſt not call him, thine. So it is not the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor proximity of place, that makes Chriſt mine: It is onely the right, that I haue to him: I haue right to him, only by faith: So by faith only, Chr. is made mine. But they thinke, they haue gotten a great vantage of vs, if we be ſo farre from Chr. as the heauen is, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth; but this ſhal be anſwered, by Gods grace: I haue a title to his body, his body is diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my body: yet his body is not diſtant from me, that is, from my ſoule, I ſay his bodie and my ſoule are conioyned. It is a ſtrange ladder,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:54"/>that will reach from the earth to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, yet let me tell you, there is a corde that extendeth from the earth to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens;
<note place="margin">Faith is that which couples vs and Chriſt.</note> and coupleth mee and Chriſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this is onely true fayth: By true faith, Chriſt, though he be in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, is coupled, and conioyned with me, who am heere on earth: I will ſhewe you this by a ſimilitude.
<note place="margin">Similitude taken from the ſunne.</note> Is not the bodie of the ſunne in the firmament? It is imposſible for you, to touch the bodie of the ſun, yet the bodie of the ſunne, and yee are conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, How? By thoſe beames that ſhine on you; by that light, that ſhineth vpon you: Why may not the bodie of Chriſt then, though it be in the heauens, be conioyned with mee, that am on the earth, namelie, by the beames, by the light, and gladnes, that floweth from his bodie? My bodie, &amp; Chriſts body are conioined, by the vertue, and power, flowing from his bodie: which vertue, and power, quickneth my dead ſoule, maketh me to liue the life of Chriſt, to beginne to die to my ſelfe: and euer the more I die to my ſelfe, the more I liue to Chriſt: This coniunction nowe is the ground as I told you, of all our felicitie, and happineſſe, and I haue made it cleere
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20181:54"/>to you at this time, ſo farre as God hath giuen me inſight: Alwaies yee ſee, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction is brought to paſſe, by two ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes; by the holy ſpirit, and by faith, If there bee no other meanes, but theſe two, what needeſt thou a carnall, or a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible coniunction? Faith is inviſible, and the ſpirit is inuiſible, therefore thou canſt not ſee it, nor take it vp with the eye of thy bodie: The power of the holy ſpirit is ſo ſubtile, ſecret, and inuiſible, that thou canſt not perceiue it, nor take it vppe, with the eye of thy bodie, and it will worke great effects in thy ſoule, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou perceiueſt his working: In reſpect therefore, that the meanes of this coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſo ſubtill, ſecret, and ſpirituall, why thinkeſt thou to get a ſight of this coniunction, with the eye of thy bodie? why imagineſt thou, ſuch a carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, as this, which would doe thee no good, if thou hadſt it? knowſt thou not, that the ſpirit, that coupleth vs, and Chriſt, is infinite? ſo that it is as eaſie for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to couplevs and Chriſt, how farre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſoeuer wee bee, as it is eaſie for our ſoules, to couple our head and the feete of our bodies, though they be diſtant. Then
<pb facs="tcp:20181:55"/>ſeeing this coniunction is the ground &amp; fountaine of all our happineſſe: And ſeeing this ground of happineſſe is ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, and ſo ſpirituall, What is your part? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue all your outward ſenſes, remoue al your naturall motions, remoue your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſcourſes, and your naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and follow the ſight and information of the ſpirit of God: Craue that it would pleaſe him, to illuminate your vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that by the light of his ſpirit, yee may ſee cleerely, the ſpirituall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Except the eye of the ſpirit be giuen you, to perceiue this ſpirituall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is not posſible, that yee can get any inſight in it. But if the Lord of his mercy, will beſtowe ſome meaſure of his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vpon you; out of queſtion, yee ſhall ſoone come to the vnderſtanding of it, and yee ſhall thinke the time happie, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yee heard this word. Except yee haue ſome part of this ſpirit, it is not posſible that yee canne bee ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>That which is borne of fleſh and bloode, will remaine fleſh and bloud, except the ſpirit come in and make it ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>Therefore yee muſt bee borne againe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20181:55"/>of the ſpirit, yee muſt bee borne in the bodie of Chriſt, his ſpirit muſt quicken you.</p>
            <p>This is called the quickning, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſpirit of Chriſt, by <hi>Iohn.</hi> And ſo ſoone as this ſpirit cometh, what doth it? It chaſeth away darkneſſe out of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: whereas before, I knewe not God, now I ſee him, not onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that he is a God, but that he is my God in Chriſt: what more doth the holy ſpirit? It opneth the heart, as well as the minde: and what doth it there? Thoſe things, whereon I beſtowed the affection of my heart, and imployed the loue of my ſoule, are by the working of the holy ſpirit, made gall to mee, he makes then venome to mee, and to bee as deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of mee, as poyſon: Hee worketh ſuch an inward diſpoſition in my ſoule, that hee makes mee to turne, and flie from thoſe things whereon I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed my loue before, and to imploy it vpon God: This is a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Alwayes in ſome meaſure, he makes mee to loue God better then anie other thing: Hee changeth the affections and inclinations of my ſoule,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:56"/>he changeth the faculties, and qualities of my ſoule: And though our hearts &amp; minde be made new, yet the ſubſtance of them is not changed, but onely the faculties, and qualities are changed, in reſpect of the which change, wee are called new creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, &amp; except you be found newe creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
<note place="margin">Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> yee are not in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the poynt. This ſecret Coniunction is brought to paſſe, by faith, and by the holy ſpirit: by faith wee lay hold on the bodie, and bloud of Chriſt: And though wee bee as farre diſtant, as heauen and earth are; the ſpirit ſerues vs, as a ladder to conioyne vs with Chriſt: As the ladder of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which reached from the ground to the heauen, to the ſelfe ſame vſe, ſerueth the ſpirit of God, to conioyne the bodie of Chriſt, with my ſoule. Then obſerue the whole in a word: what makes you to haue anie right, or title to Chriſt? Nothing, but the ſpirit: Nothing, but faith. What ſhould bee your ſtudie then? Seeke by all meanes posſible, to gett faith: That as Peter, Acts the 15.9. ſayeth, your hearts and conſciences, may be ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith: And if you endeuour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20181:56"/>not, as well to get faith in your hearts, as in your mindes, your faith auaileth not. What auaileth the faith, that fleeteth in the fantaſie, and brings a naked knowledge, without the opening of the heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the will? So, there muſt be an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy hart, and conſent of thy will, to doe that thing, that God commandeth, or elſe, thy faith availeth not: Then ſtriue to get faith in your hearts, and mindes; and doing ſo, yee doe the duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: This is not done, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hearing of the word, and diligent receiuing of the Sacrament. Then be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in theſe exerciſes, and be diligent in prayer: Praying in the holy Ghoſt, that hee would nouriſh your ſoules inwardlie, with the body, and bloud of Chriſt: That hee would increaſe faith in your hearts, and mindes, and make it to grow vp more and more daily, vntill you come to the full fruition of that bleſſed immortality: Vnto the which, the Lord of his mercie bring vs; and that for the righteous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt Ieſus: To whome with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, bee all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praiſe, and glorie, both now and euer: Amen.</p>

            <p>WE haue heard (wel-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Chriſt Ieſus) in our laſt exerciſe, what names were giuen to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, as well in the Scriptures, as by the Auncientes, of the Latine, and Eaſt Churches: wee hearde the chiefe ends wherefore, and wherevnto, this holy Sacrament was at firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: wee heard the things, that were contained in this Sacrament, what they were, how they are coupled, how they are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20181:57"/>deliuered, and how they are receiued: wee heard alſo, ſome obiections, that might bee obiected, to the contrarie of this doctrine: wee heard them propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and as God gaue the grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: wee heard how the faythfull ſoule, is ſaid to eate Chriſts bodie, and drinke Chriſts blood: Wee heard the manner, how Chriſt is, or canne bee, receiued of vs: And we concluded in this poynt, That Chriſt Ieſus, the Sauiour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, our Sauiour, cannot bee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, nor yet receiued, but by a ſpirituall way, &amp; apprehenſion. Neyther the fleſh of Chriſt, nor the bloud of Chriſt, nor Chriſt himſelfe, can bee perceiued, but by the eye of fayth; can bee receiued, but by the mouth of faith; nor can be layd hold on, but by the hand of fayth.</p>
            <p>Now faith is a ſpiritual thing: for fayth is the gift of God, poured downe into the heartes and mindes of men, and women, wrought in the ſoule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, and that by the mightie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and operation of the holy ſpirit. So, the onely waie to laie holde on Chriſt, being by faith, and faith of it owne nature, beeing ſpiritual, it followeth
<pb facs="tcp:20181:58"/>therefore that there is no waie to lay hold on Chriſt, but a ſpirituall way: there is not a hand: to faſten on Chriſt, but aſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hand, there is not a mouth, to digeſt Chriſt, but a ſpirituall mouth: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſamiliarly by all theſe tearmes, deſcribe the nature, and efficacie of faith.
<note place="margin">How we are ſaid to eate the fleſh, and drinke the blood of Chriſt.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Wee are ſaid to eate the fleſh of Chriſt by faith, and to drink his bloud by faith, in this Sacrament: chiefely in doing of two things: Firſt, in calling to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the bitter death, and pasſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt, the blood that hee ſhedde vpon the croſſe, the Supper which he inſtituted, in remembrance of him, before he went to the Croſſe: The commandement which hee gaue: <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> I ſay, wee eate his fleſh, and drinke his bloode ſpiritually. Firſt in this poynt, in recording, and remembring faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, how hee died for vs, how his blood was ſhedde vpon the croſſe. This is the firſt poynt, a point that cannot be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred truly, except it be wrought, by the mightie power of the holy ſpirit. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poynt of the ſpirituall eating, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this, That I, and euerie one of you,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20181:58"/>beleeue firmly, that he died for mee, in particular: That his bloud, was ſhedde on the croſſe, for a full remisſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of me, and my ſinnes. The cheefe, and principall poynt, of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt his fleſh, and drinking of his blood, ſtandeth in beleeuing firmely, that that fleſh, was deliuered to death for my ſinnes; that that blood, of his, was ſhedde, for the remisſion of my ſinnes: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, euerie ſoule come neere to himſelfe, and firmely conſent, and agree, and bee perſwaded, that Chriſt died for him: that ſoule can not be ſaued, that ſoule cannot eate the fleſh, nor drinke the blood of Chriſt. Then the eating of the fleſh, and drinking of the blood of Chriſt, ſtandeth in a faithfull memorie, in a firme beleefe, and in a true applying, of the merits of the death, and pasſion of Chriſt, to my owne conſcience in particular.</p>
            <p>Ther were ſundry things obiected, againſt this kind of receiuing: I wil not inſiſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them: But beſide all the obiections, which ye heard obiected, againſt this kind of ſpiritual receiuing by faith; They ſay, If Chriſt his fleſh, nor his blood, be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, nor receiued, but by the ſpirit, by
<pb facs="tcp:20181:59"/>fayth in the ſpirit: Then ſay they, yee receiue him, but by an imagination: If hee bee not receiued carnally, nor corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but onely by the ſpirit, and by faith; Then is hee not receiued, but by way of imagination, conceite, and fantaſie. So they account faith, an imagination of the minde, a fantaſie, and opinion, fleeting in the hearts of men: I cannot blame them, to think ſo of faith: For, as none can iudge of the ſweetneſſe of honnie, but they, that haue taſted of it: So, there is none, can diſcerne, nor iudge of the nature of faith, but they that haue felt it, and raſted in their hearts, what it is: And if they had taſted, and felt in their ſoules, what faith brings with it; alas, they would not call that ſpirituall Iewell, and onely iewell of the ſoule, an imagination. They call it an imagination: and the Apoſtle deſcribing it, Heb. 11.1. calleth it a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and a ſubſtantiall ground: Marke how well theſe two agree, <hi>An Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a ſubſtantiall ground.</hi> They call it an vncertaine opinion, fleeting in the braine, and fantaſie of man: Hee call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th it an euidence, and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſame definition; See how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20181:59"/>contrarie, the Apoſtle and they are, in the nature of faith. Vpon this they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that as it is true in generall, hee can not be deliuered, nor giuen, but that ſame way, that hee is receiued; and looke what way any thing is receiued, the ſame way it is giuen, and deliuered: So (as they ſay) hee being receiued by way of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee is alſo in their fantaſie, giuen and deliuered by way of Imagination. For if hee bee not giuen ſay they, to thy hand, to thy mouth, nor to thy ſtomach cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally: hee cannot be giuen, but by an imagination, and fantaſticall opinion. The reaſon that moueth them to thinke, that Chriſt cannot bee theirs, nor giuen to them truly in effect, and really, except he be giuen carnally, is this: That thing which is ſo far abſent, and diſtant from vs, as the heauen is from the earth, cannot be ſaid to bee giuen to vs, nor to bee ours: But by your owne confesſion, ſay they to vs, Chriſt his bodie, is as farre abſent from vs, as the heauen is, from the earth: Therefore Chriſt his bodie, nor his fleſh, cannot be giuen vnto vs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by way of imagination, and ſo not truely, nor in effect: This argument,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:60"/>framed in this ſorte, would at the firſt ſight, ſeeme to be of ſome force. But let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the propoſition of it: The propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this. <hi>That thing which is ſo farre abſent from vs, as the beauen is from the earth, cannot be ſaid to be deliuered to vs, to be giuen to vs, or any waies to be ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether is this propoſition true or falſe? I ſay this propoſition is vntrue, and the contrarie moſt true. A thing may be giuen to vs, &amp; may become ours, though the thing in perſon it ſelfe, be as far diſtant from vs, as the heauen is, from the earth. And how proue I this? What maketh any thing to be ours? What maketh any of you, eſteeme a thing to be giuen vnto you? Is it not a Title? Is it not a iuſt right to that thing? If yee haue iuſt right giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, by him, who hath power to giue it; and a ſure title, confirmed to you, by him, who hath the power; though the thing, that he giueth vnto you, be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered into your handes, yet by the right and title, which hee granteth to you, is not the thing yours? There is no doubt of it, for it is not the neereneſſe of the thing, to my bodie, and to my hand, that maketh the thing mine; for it may bee in my hand,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20181:60"/>and yet not belong to mee. Neyther is it the diſtance nor abſence: of the thing, that makes it, not to be mine, but it may be farre abſent from mee, and yet be mine, becauſe the title is mine, &amp; becauſe, I haue gotten a right to it, from him, who hath the power to giue it. So then, this ground is true, It is a ſure title, and a iuſt right, that maketh a thing, though it be farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from vs, to bee ours. But ſo it is, that a liuely, and trew faith, in the blood, and death of Chriſt, maketh vs to haue a ſure title, and a good right to the fleſh, and blood of Chriſt, and to his merits: look what he merited by his death, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his bloud vpon the croſſe; all that, together with himſelfe alſo, appertaineth to mee, and that by a title and a right, which I haue gotten to him, of God; which is faith: And the ſurer that my title is, the more ſure am I, of the thing that is giuen mee by the Title. Now this Sacrament, of the Lords Supper, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, to confirme our title, to ſeal vp our right, which wee haue to the bodie, and blood, to the death, and pasſion of Chriſt: and ſo, the bodie of Chriſt, is ſaid to be giuen to vs, The blood of Chriſt, is ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:20181:61"/>to be deliuered to vs, when our title, which we haue of him, of his death, of his bodie, &amp; blood, is confirmed in our hearts. For this Sacrament was inſtituted, for the grouth and encreaſe of our faith, for the increaſe of our holineſſe, and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which fayth, the greater that it is in our hearts, the more ſure are wee, that Chriſt his death appertaineth to vs. I grant as I haue ſaid, that the fleſh of Chriſt, is not deliuered into my hands, his fleſh is not put into my mouth, nor entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſtomacke: Yet God forbidde, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Hee is not truly giuen, although Chriſts fleſh, bee not put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy hand, nor mouth of thy bodie: and wherefore ſhould it? Hath hee not appointed breade, and wine, for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the bodie, and may not that content you? Are they not ſufficient to nouriſh you, to this earthly and temporall life? Hath he not appointed Chriſt to bee deliuered, to the inward mouth of thy ſoule, to be giuen into the hand of thy ſoule, that thy ſoule may feede on him, and be quickned with that life, wherewith the Angels liue, wherewith the ſonne of God, and God himſelfe liue?</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:20181:61"/>
            <p>So the fleſh of Chriſt, is not appointed to nouriſh thy body, but to nouriſh thy ſoule, in the hope, yea, in the growth of that immortall life: and therfore, I ſay, though the fleſh of Chriſt bee not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the hand of thy body, yet it is deliuered to that part that it ſhould nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: the ſoule is that part that it ſhould nouriſh, therefore to the ſoule it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
            <p>Yea, that bread, &amp; that wine, are no more really deliuered to the body &amp; to the hand of the body, then the fleſh of Chriſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the ſoule, and to the hand and mouth of the ſoule, vvhich is faith: therefore craue no more a carnall deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor thinke not vpon a carnall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
            <p>Thou muſt not thinke, that eyther GOD giueth the fleſh of Chriſt to the mouth of the bodie; or that thou, by the mouth of thy bodie, receiueſt the fleſh of Chriſt: For yee muſt vnderſtand this principle in the Scriptures of GOD; our ſoules cannot be ioyned with the fleſh of Chriſt; nor the fleſh of Chriſt, cannot be ioyned vvith our ſoules, but by a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all band. Not by a carnall band, of bloud
<pb facs="tcp:20181:62"/>and alliance; not by the touching of his fleſh, with our fleſh: but hee is conioyned with vs by a ſpirituall band; that is, by the power, and vertue of his holy Spirit. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. That by the meanes of his holy ſpirit, all wee, who are faithfull men and vvomen, are baptized into one body of Chriſt. That is, wee are conioyned, and faſtened with one Chriſt; by the meanes, ſaith he, of one ſpirit: not by a carnall band, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groſſe coniunction; but onely by the band of the holy ſpirit.</p>
            <p>That ſame holy ſpirit that is in him, is in euery one of vs, in ſome meaſure: and in reſpect one ſpirit is in him, and in vs, therefore, wee are accounted all to be one body, and to bee members of one ſpirituall, and myſticall body. And in the ſame verſe, the Apoſtle ſaith, Wee are all made to drink into one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit: that is, we are made to drink of the bloud of Chriſt. And this bloud is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but the quickning vertue, and power that floweth from Chriſt, and from the merits of his death: we are made all to drinke of that bloud, when wee drinke of the liuely power and vertue, that floweth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20181:62"/>out of that bloud.</p>
            <p>So, there is not a band that can couple my ſoule with the fleſh of Chriſt, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a ſpirituall band, and a ſpirituall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore it is that the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. ſaith, <hi>Hee that is ioyned vnto the Lord, is one ſpirit.</hi> And, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>That vvhich is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit.</hi> So, it is onely by the participation of the holy ſpirit, that we are conioyned with the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>That carnall band, vvhether it bee the band of bloud, vvhich runnes thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough one race, or the carnall touching of fleſh, vvith fleſh, that carnall band (I ſay) vvas neuer eſteemed of by Chriſt. In the time that hee was conuerſant heere vpon earth, hee reſpected nothing that band: for, as hee vvitneſſed himſelfe, by his owne vvords, hee neuer had that carnall band in any kinde of reuerence, or eſtimation, in reſpect of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all band.</p>
            <p>But, as for the ſpirituall band, whereby we are coupled with him by one ſpirit; hee euer eſteemed of this band, in the time that he was conuerſant on earth, &amp; in his word, he hath left the praiſe and commendations
<pb facs="tcp:20181:63"/>of the ſame.</p>
            <p>To let you ſee how lightly he eſteemed of the carnall band of bloud and alliance, which wee eſteeme ſo much; yee may ſee in the eight of <hi>Luke,</hi> 20.21. for there they comming to him, ſay, <hi>Maſter, thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thy Brethren ſtand vvithout, and vvould ſee thee:</hi> ye ſhall heare his anſwere vnto them, how little he eſteemed of that carnall band; in the 21. <hi>verſe,</hi> in a manner denying that band, hee ſaith; <hi>My Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my Brethren, are thoſe which heare the vvord of God, and doe it.</hi> As if he would haue ſaid, It is not that carnall band that I eſteeme: it is not that carnall coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I reuerence: it is the ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, by the participation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Spirit; vvhereby wee are mooued to heare the word of God, to giue reuerence to it, and to obey it.</p>
            <p>This carnall band, was neuer profitable, as that in the 8. of <hi>Luke</hi> doth plainly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: for, if the touching of Chriſtes fleſh had been profitable, the multitude, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made in that chapter, that thruſted, and preaſed him, had beene the better by their carnall touching. But ſo it is, that there was neuer any of them the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20181:63"/>better by their carnall touching; therfore the carnall touching profiteth nothing. Saith not Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.63. (to drawe them from that ſiniſter confidence they had in his fleſh onely) <hi>My fleſh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing; It is the ſpirit that quickneth?</hi> To touch him by the holie Spirit, and by faith in thy ſoule; this touching by faith, hath euer been profitable, and wee haue a plaine example of it in the ſame chapter.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo, the poore vvoman, that had long been diſeaſed vvith a bloudie iſſue, the ſpace of twelue yeeres, and had vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and conſumed the greateſt part of her ſubſtance, in ſeeking remedie; ſhee found no helpe by the naturall and bodily Phyſition: at the laſt, by vertue of the holie Spirit, working faith in her heart, ſhee vnderſtands and conceiues, that ſhee is able to recouer the health of her bodie, and the health of her ſoule from Chriſt Ieſus, vvho came to ſaue both body and ſoule. And vpon this perſwaſion which ſhee had in her hart, that Chriſt could cure both body and ſoule, ſhee came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and as the Text ſaith, ſhee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thorough the multitude, to come to
<pb facs="tcp:20181:64"/>him: and when ſhe was come, it is not ſaid that ſhe touched his fleſh with her hand (in caſe the Papiſts would aſcribe the vertue which came out of him, to her carnall touching): but it is ſaid, that ſhe touched onely the hemme of his garment with her hand; and with faith, vvhich is the hand of the ſoule, ſhee touched her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, God, and man. And, to let you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that ſhee touched him by ſaith, hee ſaith to her at the laſt, <hi>Goe thy way, thy faith hath ſaued thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shee touched him not ſo ſoon by faith, but incontment, there came a power out of him: which power and vertue, ſhee felt, by the effect of it in her ſoule; and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour felt it, vvhen it went from him. The effect vvhereby ſhee felt it, was, the health of her ſoule: and the effect wherby he felt it, was, the going from him. And ſo ſoone as hee felt it goe from him, he ſaith, Who is it that hath touched mee? <hi>Peter</hi> (who was euer moſt ſuddaine) anſwereth, and ſaith, Thou art thronged, and thruſted by the multitude, and yet thou askeſt, Who hath touched thee.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour anſwers againe, It is not that touching, that I ſpeake of; it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20181:64"/>kinde of touching. There is one hath touched me, who hath drawn a vertue and power out of mee: the multitude takes no vertue from me. The poore woman, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhe had done amiſſe, and perceiuing that ſhe could not be hid, came trembling, and ſaid; I haue done it. Hee anſwered her at the laſt, and ſaid, <hi>Depart in peace; thy faith hath ſaued thee.</hi> Thy faith hath drawn out a vertue, &amp; power from me, that hath made both thy ſoule &amp; body whole.</p>
            <p>So that this touching of Chriſt, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer been profitable; is, and ſhall be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: like as the touching of Chriſt, with the corporall hand, hath neuer beene, is not, nor euer ſhall be profitable. And why? Chriſt is not appointed to be a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall head; to be ſet vpon the necks of our bodies, that he may doe the office of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall head therunto, to furniſh naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; ſenſes to our bodies. No, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call not Chriſt a natural head, but the Scriptures call him a ſpirituall head, to be ſet on the neck of our ſoules: that is, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned with our ſoules; that out of him, into our ſoules may diſtill holy motions, heauenly ſenſes; and that there may flowe out of him to vs, a ſpiritual &amp; heauenly life.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:65"/>
            <p>Then the Scriptures call him a ſpiritu-head, as they call vs a ſpirituall body: and, as the life which wee get from him, is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; ſo all our coniunction with him, is ſpirituall. And in reſpect he worketh that ſame operation in my ſoule, vvhich the carnall head doth in my body, therefore hee is called a ſpirituall head: therefore hee is called the head of his Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee furniſheth her vvith ſpirituall motion, and ſenſes, vvhich is the life of the Church.</p>
            <p>So, to be ſhort, there is nothing in this coniunction, carnall; there is nothing groſſe in it; there is nothing that may be compaſſed, by our naturall iudgement &amp; vnderſtanding. And therefore, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would attaine to any ſmall in-ſight of this ſpiritual coniunction, between Chriſt, and vs; of neceſsity, hee muſt humble himſelfe, and earneſtly pray for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; otherwiſe, it is not poſsible to get any vnderſtanding, no, not the leaſt perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, how the fleſh of Chriſt, and vve are conioyned, except we haue ſome light gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs by the ſpirit; that is, except our harts be wakened, by the mighty working of the ſpirit of Chriſt, this ſhall remaine as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20181:65"/>a dead, and cloſed letter vnto vs. So,
<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> yee are to craue, that the Lord in his mercie would waken you; illuminate your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; and make you to haue a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall light, to diſcerne of theſe ſpirituall things. Next, ye muſt ſtudy, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to remoue all vaine cogitations, and earthly fantaſies: when yee come to heare ſo high a matter, yee muſt caſt off all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thoughts, ill motions, and cares of the world; and yee muſt ſhake off all things that clogge your harts. Thirdly, yee muſt come with a purpoſe to heare the vvord, to giue diligent care to the word, and with a ſanctified hart to receiue it; vvith a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to growe, and increaſe in holineſs, as well in body, as in ſoule, all the dayes of your life.</p>
            <p>And, comming with this purpoſe, no queſtion, the holy Spirit ſhall reueale thoſe things to you, which yee want. And though this word paſſe, and bring no great commodity for the preſent, yet the holy Spirit heereafter, ſhall reueale to thee, the truth of that which thou haſt now heard. Then this is the end of all; Bee preſent in your harts, and mindes, and let your ſoules be emptied of all the cares of the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:66"/>vvorld, that they may receiue that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is offered in the hearing of the word.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the defining of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper.
<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</note> I call this Sacrament, <hi>A holy Seale,</hi> annexed to the couenant of grace, and mercy in Chriſt. A ſeale to be miniſtred publiquely, alwaies according to the holy inſtitution of Chriſt Ieſus: that by the lawful miniſtery therof, the Sacramentall vnion, betweene the ſignes, and the thing ſignified, may ſtand: and this vnion ſtanding, Chriſt Ieſus, who is the thing ſignified, is as truely deliuered to the increaſe of our ſpirituall nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the ſignes are giuen, &amp; deliuered to the body, for our temporall nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now let vs examine the words &amp; parts of this definition.
<note place="margin">Why this Sacrament is called a Seale.</note> Firſt of all, I call this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, a Seale; becauſe this Sacrament ſerueth to the ſame vſe to our ſoules, that a common ſeale doth to a common Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. As the ſeale, which is annexed to the Euidence, confirmes, and ſeales vp the truth, contained in the Euidence: ſo this Sacrament, of the body and bloud of Chriſt, confirmeth, and ſealeth vp, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20181:66"/>truth of mercy and grace, contayned in the couenant of mercy and grace: for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it is called a ſeale.</p>
            <p>It is called, <hi>A holy Seale.</hi> Why?
<note place="margin">Why it is called a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seale.</note> Becauſe it is taken from the profane vſe, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that bread ſerued before; and that bread is applyed to a holy vſe. There is a power giuen to that bread, to ſignifie the precious body of Chriſt Ieſus, to repreſent the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and feeding of our ſoules. And in reſpect it ſerueth now in the Sacrament to ſo holy an vſe, therefore I call it an holie ſeale. This is not my word; it is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. where hee giueth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the ſame name, and calleth it a ſeale. And further, if the wiſdom of Chriſt in his Apoſtle, had been followed, and if men had not inuented new names of their own, for this Sacrament, but contented, &amp; ſatisfied themſelues, with the names which God hath giuen by his Apoſtle, &amp; that Chr. himſelf hath giuen to this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; I am aſſured, none of theſe controuerſies &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bares (which neuer will ceaſe) had fallen out: but where men wil go about to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; go beyond God, in deuiſing names which he neuer gaue, vpon mens own inuentions, ſuch debates haue faln out.
<pb facs="tcp:20181:67"/>A leſſon by the vvay; that no fleſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be wiſer then GOD: but let them ſtoupe, and keepe the names which God hath giuen to this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Why the ſeale is ſaid to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> I ſay, annexed to the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; annexed, and hung to the Charter: becauſe it cannot be called a ſeale proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except it be hung to an Euidence. What it is by nature, the ſame it remaineth, and no more, if it be not annexed to ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence: it is onely the hanging of it to the Euidence, that maketh men account it a ſeale; not beeing eſteemed, except it be hanged to the Euidence. Euen ſo it is heere; if this Sacrament be not miniſtred, and ioyned to the preached vvord, to the preaching of the couenant of mercie, and grace, it cannot be a ſeale; but what it is by nature, it is no more. As by nature, it is but a common peece of bread; ſo it is no more if it be not annexed to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, and miniſtred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as Chriſt hath commaunded. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, the ſeale muſt be annexed, and hanged to the Euidence, to the preaching of the word, for the confirming of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence; otherwiſe, it is not a ſeale. But, it is not ſo with the Euidence vvhich is the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20181:67"/>word of GOD: for yee knowe, any Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will make faith, though it vvant a ſeale; and it will ſerue to make a right, if it be ſubſcribed, without a ſeale: but the ſeale without the Euidence, auaileth nothing. Euen ſo it is with the word of God: though the Sacraments bee not annexed to the word, yet the word will ſerue the turne: it ſerueth vs to get Chriſt, it ſerueth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender, and beget faith in vs, and maketh vs to growe vp in faith. But the ſeale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word, can ſerue vs to no holievſe: therefore, I ſay, the ſeale muſt be annexed to the word preached, to the couenant of mercy, and grace.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth in the definition,
<note place="margin">Why the Sacrament ſhould be miniſtred publiquely.</note> that this ſeale muſt bee miniſtred publiquely. Wherefore ſay I publiquely? To exclude all priuat adminiſtration of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For, if this Sacrament be adminiſtred to any priuately, it is not a Sacrament. Why?
<note place="margin">Firſt reaſon.</note> Becauſe the Apoſtle calleth this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Communion. If ye adminiſter it to one, yee loſe the Communion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if yee adminiſter it priuatly, yee loſe the Sacrament. For this Sacrament, is a Communion of the body, and bloud of Chriſt: therefore, of neceſsity, it muſt be
<pb facs="tcp:20181:68"/>by way of communication; and ſo the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be publiquely miniſtred.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Sacrament muſt be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely miniſtred,
<note place="margin">Second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> becauſe Chriſt Ieſus, vvho is the thing ſignified in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is no ſuch thing as pertaineth but to one man only: if this were ſo, he might be priuatly giuen and miniſtred. But, ſeeing Chriſt, which is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, is a common thing, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to euery faithfull man and vvoman, therefore hee ought to be commonly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all, in a common action, in a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, and congregation of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this Sacrament, is a Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God the Father, for his benefits. Now, it appertaineth not to one, or tvvo, to thanke God onely; but as we are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his temporall, and ſpirituall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: ſo we ought all of vs, publiquely to giue him thanks for the ſame. Therefore I ſay, in the definition, this ſeale ought to be publiquely, and not priuatly miniſtred; as the Papiſts doe in their priuat Maſſes.</p>
            <p>This Seale muſt bee publiquely mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, according to Chriſt his inſtitution. Wherfore ſay I Chriſt his inſtitution, more then mans inſtitution, or Angels inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20181:68"/>Why keepe I to Chriſt his inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<note place="margin">Why this Seale muſt be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chr. his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Becauſe man hath not power to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, or make a Sacrament: becauſe an Angel hath not power to make, or inſtitute a Sacrament. For, none hath power to make, or inſtitute a Sacrament, but he that hath power to giue Chriſt, vvho is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament.
<note place="margin">None hath power to inſtitute a Sacrament, but God onely.</note> But ſo it is, that none hath power to giue Chriſt, but either the Father, or himſelfe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, none hath power to make, or inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Sacrament, but either the Father, or the Sonne: onely God muſt make a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, this Sacrament is a part of Gods ſeruice, and worſhip: but ſo it is that none hath power to appoint any part of his ſeruice, or preſcribe any part of his worſhip, but onely God himſelfe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none can make a Sacrament, but God himſelfe. There is no Prince will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be ſerued after another mans fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie: but he will preſcribe his ſeruice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto his own pleaſure: how much more is it meet, that God ſhould appoint his owne ſeruice, and worſhip? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is neither man, nor Angel, hath power to inſtitute any part of the ſeruice of GOD.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:69"/>
            <p>The Sacraments are a part of his ſeruice: therefore there is no Angel, nor man, hath power to inſtitute a Sacrament. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtile that any man can haue in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word and Sacraments, is that ſtile, which the Apoſtle giues them, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. There we are called Stewards, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of the graces of God; Miniſters of thoſe myſteries, and holy things. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth then, that we are not Authors, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, and makers of them; but onely Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and diſpenſers of the Sacraments. So, it is euident, that no man, nor creature, hath power to make a Sacrament. Then it muſt bee according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, his inſtitution muſt be kept: looke what he ſaid, what he did, what hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee to doe; all that muſt be ſaid, done, and obeyed. If thou leaueſt one iote of that vndone, which he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee to doe, thou peruerteſt the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: for, there is nothing left in regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that inſtitution, but it is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.</p>
            <p>So, in the celebration of Chriſts inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee muſt take heede, to whatſoeuer he ſaid, did, or commaunded to bee done: Thou muſt firſt ſay, whatſoeuer hee ſaid,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20181:69"/>&amp; then do whatſoeuer he did. For the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the Sacrament muſt follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the word. Firſt thou muſt ſay, that which Chriſt commanded thee to ſay, and thou muſt teach, that which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee to teach: and then miniſter the Sacrament: Then to keepe this inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee muſt beginne at the ſaying,
<note place="margin">We call the word in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the whole Inſtitution</note> and ſay whatſoeuer Chriſt commanded vs, then after, faythfully to doe all that, which he commanded to be done. Then I call the word, the whole inſtitution of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, preached, and proclaimed, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced diſtinctly, cleerely, and ſenſiblie to the people, in ſuch ſort, that if wee leaue anie kinde of circumſtance, or ceremonie of this inſtitution vndone, wee peruert the whole action.</p>
            <p>It is agreed vpon,
<note place="margin">Word and element muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> and condeſcended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, betweene vs, who celebrate this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and all the ſectes in the world, who haue ſeparated themſelues from this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, That two things are neceſſarie, and muſt concurre in the nature, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sacrament. To wit, there muſt be a word, and there muſt bee an element concurring: There is not a ſect, that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not this, That the word muſt concur,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:70"/>with the element, before there can be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Though they eaſily admit this generall, wherein wee agree well with them, yet when it comes to the ſpeciall, &amp; that wee enter into particular, in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and treating of the word; how well ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee agree in the generall, yet in the particular, wee are as farre aſunder. For, when wee come to diſpute, and reaſon on theſe particulars; Firſt, what wee meane by the word: Secondly, how this word ought to be intreated: Thirdly, what vertue this word hath: Fourthly, how farre the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this word, doth extend it ſelfe: And laſt of all, to whom the word ought to be directed, and pronounced: In all theſe particulars, wee are as farre aſunder, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee ſeemed to agree in the generall.</p>
            <p>I leaue to meddle with any other ſect,
<note place="margin">What wee meane by the word in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> but will deale with the Papiſts onely, becauſe we haue moſt to do with them: And firſt of all we are to vnderſtand, what wee meane by the word, &amp; what they meane by it. We by the word (as I haue ſaid) vnderſtand the whole inſtitution of Chr. Ieſus, whatſoeuer he ſaid, or did, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to bee done, without adding, or diminiſhing, or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the meaning, or ſenſe of the word: This we mean by the word in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:20181:70"/>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">What the Papiſts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the word in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> what vnderſtand the Papiſts by the word? They preach not the inſtitution of Chriſt, nor take the whole inſtitution, as he left it. But in place thereof, they ſelect, and chuſe out of his inſtitution, foure, or fiue words, &amp; they make the whole vertue of the inſtitution, to conſiſt in the foure, or fiue words. And it were nothing, if they would content themſelues with theſe words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the words of the inſtitution. But they adde to the words, they take from the words, &amp; alter the meaning of the ſame words, at their pleaſure. That yee may knowe this; In their Maſſe, which they call the Lords Supper, I will let you ſee the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it: I will diuide their Maſſe, into ſubſtantiall, &amp; accidentall things. To the ſubſtance of the Maſſe, there are three things required. There muſt of necesſitie be a prieſt .i. ſuch a one, as takes vpon him the office of our Mediator, Chr. Ieſ. to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede between God, &amp; man. Secondly, to the ſubſtance of the Maſſe, is required, that the Prieſt offer the bodie, and blood of Chriſt. We come here to receiue the ſame things: There the prieſt offers them to God the father. Thirdly, by this worke (ſay they) they obtaine al good things: by
<pb facs="tcp:20181:71"/>this work wrought, they obtaine remisſion of ſinnes, as well to the dead, as to the quicke; but in ſpeciall, they obtaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misſion of ſinnes to the prieſt, who is the diſtributer, and to him, to whom, the prieſt applieth that ſacrifice: And as for the reſt of the Church who are abſent, they obtaine this remisſion of their ſinnes, by this work generally. Theſe three things are neceſſarie, to the ſubſtance of the Maſſe: As for the accidents, that muſt concurre to the making of a Maſſe, They are of two ſorts: Some of them are alwaies neceſſarie, without the which, that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot bee: againe, ſome are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, and the action may bee without them, but not without a deadlie ſinne: Theſe things that are neceſſarie, concerne partly the prieſt, and partly the action it ſelfe. The accidents that are neceſſarie to the prieſt, are of two ſorts: One ſort are ſuch, as without the which, hee cannot be a prieſt; The other ſort ſuch, without the which, hee cannot bee free from deadly ſin. The things without the which he can not be a prieſt, are theſe: Except he haue a power giuen of his Biſhop to conſecrate, which power is iuſtified by the vnction, &amp;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20181:71"/>ſhauing of his crowne: Except again, he haue power to ſpeake, and that the roofe of his mouth be whole, that he may ſpeak, hee cannot bee a prieſt: Theſe two are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies neceſſarie, and concurre to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Other things againe, are not ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie; as, that the prieſt muſt be free from ſuſpenſion, from curſing, deadly ſinne, and all Eccleſiaſticall pain, &amp; cenſures. Theſe things are neceſſarie to the perſon. There are again, two things neceſſary to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: One ſort, without the which the action cannot bee; without the Lords prayer it cannot bee, without the fiue words of the inſtitution, it cannot bee: Other things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, are not ſo neceſſarie; as, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the place, where the Maſſe is ſaid, The Altar ſtone, The blesſing of the Chalice, The water, The ſinging, he that ſhould helpe to ſay Maſſe, and the reſt. So they and wee, in no ſort agree concerning the word, what is meant by it. The ſecond point is, how this word ought to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wherein wee are as farre aſunder: we ſay, the word taken as hath beene ſaid, for the whole inſtitution, ought to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, after this manner. Firſt, there ought to be a lawfull paſtor, who hath his calling
<pb facs="tcp:20181:72"/>of God, to deliuer it. And this paſtor ought to deliuer the word lawfully; what is that? hee ought to preach it, to proclaime it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, with a plaine ſpeech to denounce it: hee ought to open vp, and declare, all the parts of it, what is the peoples part, and what is his owne part, how he ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer, and diſtribute that bread, and that wine, how the people ought to receiue, at his hands, that bread, and that wine, to informe their faith, how they ought to receiue Chriſts bodie, and bloud, ſignified by that bread, and that wine. As alſo, hee ought to teach them, how they ſhuld come with reuerence, vnto that Table, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the pretious bodie, and blood of Chriſt: This hee ought to doe, in a familiar language, that the people may vnderſtand him, that they may heare him, that they may perceiue, and lay vp in their hearts, the things that hee ſpeakes. For what auaileth it you, to heare a thing whiſpered, and not ſpoken out: or if it be ſpoken out, what auaileth it you to heare it, if yee vnderſtand it not? For, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee heare Chriſt, in a familiar, and plaine language, yee cannot vnderſtand: and except ye vnderſtand, it is imposſible
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20181:72"/>for you to beleeue: and without beleefe, there is no application of Chriſt: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee beleeue, and apply Chriſt to your ſelues, your comming to the Sacrament is in vaine. So of necesſitie, if this Sacrament be lawfully handled, The paſtor muſt preach the inſtitution of Chriſt, that it may be heard; and in a familiar language, that it may be vnderſtood, in ſuch ſort that the faithfull people may be informed how to receiue, and the Miniſter may knowe his part, how to deliuer, and diſtribute. This I ſay, ſhould bee the right handling of the holy inſtitution of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now what do they? in place of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, paſtor, or Biſhoppe (call him as you pleaſe) who is lawfully called of God; they ſubſtitute a prieſt, ſurrogate an hierling, who hath no calling, or office now, in the church of God. For the office of a prieſt, as they vſe their prieſthoode, is no other thing, but the office of Chriſt Ieſus, the office of the Mediator, betwixt God and vs: for they make their prieſts dailie to offer vppe Chriſt Ieſus, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now this is the Mediator, Chr. his office, that he did it, once for all, once for euer, ſaith the Apoſtle: ſo that they haue no
<pb facs="tcp:20181:73"/>entrance, to doe this ouer againe: And in reſpect, that their prieſts do this againe, which Chriſt hath done alreadie, they doe it without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, they haue no warrant in the word of God. And if they had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for their calling, in the word of God, yet they handle the Sacrament amiſſe: for whereas they ſhould ſpeake forth cleerely, they whiſper, and they coniure the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by a certaine kind of whiſpering. Wheras they ſhould ſpeake it, in a knowen language, that the people may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; They ſpeake, in an vnknowen lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and though they ſpake it, in a known &amp; familiar tongue, yet in that they whiſper it, the people cannot be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And what ſhall I ſay? Seeing they thus handle the word, though it be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in ſtitution it ſelfe, yet they ſo ſpoile it, in the handling, that it is not a holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then wee differ as much in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poynt, how that word ought to bee handled, and intreated.</p>
            <p>Now the third point is,
<note place="margin">The third head in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</note> what vertue this word hath, how farre the vertue of this word extendeth it ſelfe: In this point, we grant &amp; acknowledge, that the word hath a vertue: and the word taken, as hath bin
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20181:73"/>ſaid, worketh ſomewhat, euen towards the ſame elements, of bread, and wine; for wee acknowledge, that thoſe elements, by the vertue of this word, are changed, not in their ſubſtance, and naturall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But wee grant, that the elements are changed, in a quality which they had not before; In ſuch ſort, that theſe elements, are taken from the common vſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they ſerued before, and by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, they are applied vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other holy vſe. Marke, how farre the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe differs from the common vſe, there is as great difference, betwixt the elements, this day in the action, and the thing that they were yeſterday: For I grant, that the elements are changed; &amp; yet this change, proceedeth not, of the nature of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from an incloſed vertue, ſuppoſed to bee in the words, nor from the whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the words: but it proceeds, from the will of Chriſt, from the ordinance, &amp; appointment of Chriſt, ſet downe in his owne inſtitution: for that thing is holy, which God calleth holy; and that thing is profane, which God calleth profane.</p>
            <p>To let you vnderſtand, how theſe ſignes are made holy, it is neceſſarie, that theſe
<pb facs="tcp:20181:74"/>two things bee conſidered.
<note place="margin">How the elements are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> Firſt, what hee is that makes them holy, whether God, Angell, or man. Secondly, whoeuer he bee, that maketh them holy, by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; way, he maketh them holy. And by the conſideration of theſe two, wee ſhall come to the conſideration, and right view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſanctification of the Elements.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, wee ſay, that God is onely hee, that may make a thing which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to be holy. So we ſay, that God by his will and ordinance, declared, and ſet downe, in his word, hath made the things, that were common, by his appoyntment to bee holy. As for the way, and meanes whereby they are made holy, it is the word of God, the inſtitution of Chriſt, the will of Chriſt, declared in his inſtitution, that maketh them holy. For the preaching, and opening of the word, and inſtitution of Chriſt, letteth vs ſee, that god hath made theſe things holy: and not onely, that hee hath made them holy, but let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs ſee an holy manner, how they ſhould be vſed, in what place, at what time with what heart, &amp; to what end. So it is the wil of Chriſt, declared in his inſtitution, wherby the things that were common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are now made holy. There are two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20181:74"/>things alſo, which make the ſame ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, holy: &amp; theſe two, are vſed in this inſtitution. There is praier, &amp; thankſgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which make the creatures of God to our vſe, holy: whereas otherwiſe, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the good creatures of God, like dogs, &amp; thank him not for them, it is a ſure token that they were neuer ſanctified to our vſe.</p>
            <p>By prayer we obtaine grace, &amp; ſtrength from God, to vſe the creatures, and this whole action, holily &amp; lawfully, as it ſhold be. And therefore not onely, in this holy action, ſhould we begin with God, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of his name, but in all actions in the world, we ſhould begin in the name of God. So it is the wil of God, praier, and thankſgiuing, conioined with the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that make them holy. All theſe three, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the action of the Lords Supper, make the Seales holy: For, beſide the wil of God, declared in the inſtitution, In the Lords Supper, we vſe inuocation; and in this inuocation, we vſe thankeſgiuing. The elements are not made holy, by the word of God onely, but by the vſe of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſgiuing, which three, are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means, wherby theſe things are ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified.</p>
            <p>Now, to expreſſe, and laie-foorth,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:75"/>the ſanctification of the Elements:
<note place="margin">The word of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing vſed indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, the one expreſſed by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> The Euangeliſts, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> vſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently the word, <hi>To bleſſe,</hi> and <hi>to giue thankes,</hi> and commonly they put, the one for the other: For yee may ſee, that <hi>Marke,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> vſe the word <hi>Bleſſe: Mathew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> vſe the word <hi>to giue thankes,</hi> and all in one ſignification: And <hi>Marke</hi> himſelfe in the 14. of his Goſpell, 22. verſe, ſpeaking of the ſame action of the Lords Supper, vſeth the word to <hi>Bleſs,</hi> and in the 23. verſe, he vſeth the word to <hi>Giue thanks,</hi> and both in one ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to let you ſee, that the Apoſtle, Chriſt himſelfe, and the Euangiliſts, vſe the word to <hi>Bleſſe,</hi> and to <hi>Giue thankes,</hi> indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſignifie the ſanctification, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the elements. Except, ye take the one for the other, it will bee hard to gather anie good meaning out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words: for I remember the Apoſtle, 1. Corin. 10.16. ſayth: <hi>The Cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which we bleſſe,</hi> what is that? I take the word to ſignifie, as I haue ſaid, <hi>which wee bleſſe,</hi> that is, which wee ſanctifie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare by blesſing. So, to bleſſe, and to giue thankes in the Lords Supper, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no other thing, but to ſanctifie: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20181:75"/>if ye take the word, in another ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yee ſhall fall into an error: and and why? God is ſayde to bleſſe, and man is ſaid to bleſſe: God is ſaid to bleſſe, when hee giueth good things vnto his creatures, for Gods blesſing is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer effectuall; and therefore hee is ſaid to bleſſe, when he giueth good things. Man againe, is ſaid to bleſſe either priuately, or publikely, when hee craueth blesſing, at the hands of God, to anie man; when hee bleſſeth, in the name, and at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, anie perſon, or people: Now, if yee aſcribe blesſing, in any of theſe two ſignifications to the cuppe, it is amiſſe: for wee vſe neyther to craue a blesſing, to inſenſible elements; nor yet to bleſſe them, in the name of God: And God vſeth to giue good things, to the ſonnes of men, and not to inſenſible creatures: Therefore we muſt needes vſe the word, <hi>Bleſſe,</hi> in the third ſignification. <hi>The cuppe of blesſing, which wee bleſſe,</hi> that is, which wee ſanctifie, and prepare by blesſing: Thus farre wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, for the ſanctification of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee, how they ſanctifie the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:76"/>elements, &amp; what is the forme of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, ſo far as I vnderſtand of it, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in theſe fiue words: <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus meum:</hi> It ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in theſe fiue words, and in the whiſpering of them; for if you whiſper them not, ye loſe the faſhion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation: for the thing which we call ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, they call whiſpering: And the whiſpering of thoſe fiue words, they call the conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the elements: And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the words are after this manner whiſpered, they preſuppoſe, ſuch a ſecret, &amp; mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous vertue, to be incloſed in the ſyllables, That the vertue, &amp; power which floweth from the words, is able to chaſe away wholly, the ſubſtance of the bread, ſo that the very bread, &amp; ſubſtance of it, is altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied, by this power: Secondly, that this power which floweth from theſe words, is able to fetch, &amp; pull downe an otherſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to wit, the fleſh, &amp; blood of Chriſt Ieſus, that fitteth at the right hand of his father, &amp; is able to put it within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of that bread: This is a ſtrange and a great vertue, that, not only wil ouerthrowe that ſubſtance, but put it within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of that bread. The ſame fiue words, whiſpered in this maner, haue ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20181:76"/>operation, ſay they, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both to chaſe a way the one ſubſtance, to pull downe an other, and to put it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of that bread. We altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their denie, That there is ſuch a vertue in theſe words: for, as I haue ſaid before, wee denie not, that the word hath a vertue, but denie that there is ſuch a vertue incloſed in the words; wee denie the qualitie of the vertue, or that it floweth, from ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. For, we grant, that the word hath a vertue; there is neuer a word, that God ſpeaketh heere, but it hath a vertue ioyned withit: but wee deny, that this vertue is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the ſyllables, in the whiſpering, or pronouncing of the words: for if there were ſuch avertue, and power incloſed in the ſyllables, by the ſame reaſon it ſhould follow, that there were avertue in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and ſhape of the letter, that makes vp thewords. Now, there is noman wil think that there is any vertue in the figure, or ſhape of the letter: and there is as little vertue in the ſyllables or pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the words themſelues. So wee denie, that there is anie vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the ſyllables, or reſident in the word. But wee ſay, that there is
<pb facs="tcp:20181:77"/>a power conioyned with the word, and this power is not reſident in the word, but is reſident, in the eternal word, in the eſſential Word wherof <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt makes mention. Cap. 1. <hi>The word which was from the beginning,</hi> that is, the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus: wee ſay, there is not a dram weight of this vertue, and power reſident in any creature that euer God created, but it is onely reſident in Chriſt Ieſus: And therefore there floweth no vertue from the ſillables, nor from the words that are ſpoken, but from Chriſt, and his ſpirit, who giues the vertue to thoſe words. So wee differ in this; we ſay that there is not anie vertue reſident in the ſillables, wee ſay that the ſillables, and pronouncing of the ſillables, work nothing: but wee ſay that the vertue is reſident in the perſon of the ſonne of God, and heeworkes by his owne word.</p>
            <p>Now wee ſay that there cannot be ſuch a monſtrous change, as to ſay the whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſo manie wordes, ſhould change the owne ſubſtance of the bread, pull down the ſubſtance of the bodie of Chriſt, and put his bodie in ſo narrow a compaſſe, wee ſay that cannot bee. And this I ſhall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20181:77"/>proue by theſe three rules; namely,
<note place="margin">Refutation of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by 3. ſorts of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</note> By the veritie of the fleſh of Chriſt Ieſus; By the articles of our Beliefe; And by the true end of the inſtitution of this Sacrament. And ſo we ſhall ſee, by Gods grace, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite abſurdities that follow vpon their opinion.</p>
            <p>The firſt principle that I lay, is this;
<note place="margin">The firſt ſort of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt Ieſus, the Sonne of GOD, in the time appointed, tooke true fleſh of the wombe of the Virgin, and vnited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with our nature in one perſonall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to the end that our nature, which fell altogether from integritie in the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> might recouer the ſame in the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> yea, not onely the ſame, but ſo much the greater, as our ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells the firſt in all de grees: And in reſpect hee tooke on him a body, like vnto ours in all things (ſinne excepted) of neceſsity it muſt follow, that the definition of a true body, and the inſeparable properties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, muſt be competent to him. But theſe are the inſeparable properties; namely, to be in one certaine place, to be finite, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed, viſible, and palpable: for all theſe concurre (<hi>quarto modo,</hi> as the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſay) to a body; ſo that they cannot
<pb facs="tcp:20181:78"/>be ſeparate from the ſubiect, without the diſtraction thereof. Then Treaſon on this manner; <hi>A true humane body, is in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place; Chriſt Ieſus body, is a true, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body: therefore it is in a certaine place.</hi> I call a place, a certaine condition of an inſtrumentall bodie, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that where-euer the body be, of neceſsitie, it is limited within that place; and vvhile it is there, it cannot bee elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>If you would haue the probation of my Propoſition from the Doctors, read <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> to <hi>Dardanus,</hi> ſpeaking of this ſame body of Chriſt. Take avvay a certaine roome from the bodies, and they ſhall be in no place; and if they be in no place, they are not. The ſame <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> writing vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his 30. Treatiſe, ſaith, The body in the which the Lord did ariſe, of neceſsity muſt be in a place; but his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine efficacie and nature, is diffuſed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. And in his third Epiſtle, he ſaith, How much ſoeuer the body be, or how little ſoeuer the body be, it behoues to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the bounds of a place. And, beſides theſe, the hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> proueth moſt euidently Chriſt his body to be in a certain
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20181:78"/>place: as <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. the words are theſe; <hi>Whom the heauens muſt containe, vntill the time that all things be reſtored, vvhich God had ſpoken by the mouth of all his holie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Though I need not to inſiſt in the probation of theſe things, yet I proceede. Secondly then I reaſon after this manner; A humane body is finite, and circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; but the body of Chriſt is a humane body. What warrant from the Doctors haue I for this? I leaue many purpoſely, &amp; will alleage onely <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who writing to <hi>Dardanus, Belieue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt to be euery where, in that he is God; but onely to be in heauen, according to the nature of a true body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in his 146. Epiſtle, <hi>I belieue,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the body of Chriſt to be ſo in heauen, as it vvas on the earth, vvhen hee vvent vp to heauen.</hi> But it was circumſcribed in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place on the earth. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is ſo in the heauen. And conſequently, it cannot be in the Maſſe-bread, and in heauen both at one time. The laſt reaſon is this: A humane bodie is viſible, and palpable; but Chriſt hath a humane body, and hee is corporally preſent, as they ſay: therefore Chriſt his body is viſible, and palpable.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:79"/>
            <p>I proue my Propoſition, by Chriſt his owne words, taken out of <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. In the which place, to perſwade the Apoſtles of the verity of his body, and to proue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, that it was not fantaſticall, heev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the argument taken from theſe tvvo qualities, and he commands his Apoſtles to feele, and ſee; giuing them thereby to vnderſtand, that as theſe two ſenſes are the moſt certaine of all the reſt: ſo are they moſt able to diſcerne, whether hee was a body, or a ſpirit. As if he would haue ſaid, If I be viſible, and palpable, ye may be out of doubt that I haue a true body. For as the Poet ſaith, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> citeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to this ſame purpoſe; <hi>Tangere enim, et tangi, niſi corpus, nulla poteſtres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe arguments, it may be euidently ſeen, how this Tranſubſtantiation, may no way ſtand with the verity of the bodie of Chr. Ieſus: And as it fights with the fleſh of Chriſt Ieſus; ſo it repugnes directly, the articles of our faith. For, in our Beliefe, we profeſſe,
<note place="margin">Second ſort of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> that Chriſt aſcended out of this earth, to the heauen, where hee ſits at the right hand of the Father, vvhere hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerns, and directs all things in heauen and earth; from the which place, he is to come
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20181:79"/>at the laſt day, to iudge the world.</p>
            <p>This article teacheth vs, that hee hath changed his dwelling vvhich hee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, on the earth, and is aſcended into the heauens, where he ſits at the right hand of his Father, and ſhall remaine there (according to the teſtimony of <hi>Peter,</hi> which I cited out of the <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21.) vntill the laſt day. If hee ſit at his Fathers right hand, and be to remaine in heauen vntill the laſt day, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he not corporally in the bread. But the article of our Beliefe, ſaith, That he ſitteth at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in that place, that the heauens muſt containe him vntill the laſt day. Therefore, this Tranſubſtantiation, is directly againſt the articles of our Beliefe, &amp; the manifeſt place of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is oppoſite vnto the end,
<note place="margin">Third ſort of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> wherefore this Sacrament was inſtituted, &amp; this is moſt euident: for the end of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is ſpirituall, as the effect that floweth thereof, is ſpiritual, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby this ſpirituall food is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to vs, is alſo ſpiritual. But from a naturall, and corporall preſence, a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all effect can neuer flowe: therefore the corporall, and naturall preſence of the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:80"/>body and bloud of Chriſt Ieſus, repugnes directly the end of this Sacrament: for the corporall preſence, muſt haue a corporall eating: of this eating, followeth a digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſtomacke: and the thing that is digeſted in the ſtomack, is neuer able to feed my ſoule to life eternall. So this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall preſence, muſt euer tend to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall end; which is directly contrarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end wherefore this Sacrament was inſtituted.</p>
            <p>Further,
<note place="margin">Other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto the ſame effect.</note> if the bread were tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, it ſhould become the thing ſignified; if it become the thing ſignified, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould want a ſigne, and ſo it ſhould not be a Sacrament: for euery Sacrament, as yee haue heard, is a ſigne. Now, to ſay that the accidents of true bread, as the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the roundneſſe of it, that they may ſerue as ſignes, that is more then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for, between the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, there muſt be a conformity: but there is no conformity between the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and the body and bloud of Chriſt Ieſus. For if that were ſo, the accidents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed to nouriſh vs corporally; as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Chriſt Ieſus, is appointed to nouriſh vs ſpiritually.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:20181:80"/>
            <p>Againe, if the bread become the body and bloud of Chriſt Ieſus, it ſhould follow, that he had a body without bloud; for hee hath inſtituted another ſigne beſides, to repreſent his bloud. Alſo, if there had been ſuch a wonderfull thing as they ſpeak of, in this Sacrament, there would haue been plaine mention made thereof in the Scripture: for, God himſelfe works neuer a notable worke, but he declares it, either openly, or more ſecretly in the Scripture, that thereby hee may be glorified in his wonderfull works. As yee may read in the Euangeliſt <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ohn,</hi> 2.8. where the vvater was changed into wine; <hi>Gene.</hi> 2.22. where the rib of <hi>Adam,</hi> was changed into <hi>Heua: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> 7.10. where <hi>Aarons</hi> rodde was turned into a Serpent: there ye ſee, that changing is manifeſtly expreſſed. Therefore I ſay, if there had bin ſuch a monſtrous change in theſe eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Supper as they affirm, the Scripture would not haue concealed it, but expreſſed it: but in reſpect there is no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion made of this change in the Script. therfore there is no ſuch change in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Further, if there were ſuch a change, as they ſay, either it is before theſe words of conſecration be ſpoken, or followes after
<pb facs="tcp:20181:81"/>the ſame words be ſpoken. If the change be before the words of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration be ſpoken, the conſecration is ſuperfluous, &amp; their Propoſition is falſe: if the change be after the words be ſpoken, <hi>This bread is my body,</hi> their Propoſition is falſe alſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word <hi>bread,</hi> is ſpoken, before the laſt ſyllable of their fiue words is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Theſe, and infinite moe abſurdities, follow of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>And yet they obſtinately perſeuer, and vrge vs with the letter, affirming that the words of Chriſt are ſo plaine, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no figure. They would haue ſpoken more aduiſedly, if they had ſought coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to haue diſcerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a figuratiue ſpeech, and a proper ſpeech: for he, in his third booke, and 16. chapter of Chriſtian doctrine, ſpeakes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort; <hi>If the ſpeech,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>ſeeme to commaund a vvickedneſs, or miſcheife, on to forbid any happineſſe, or any vvelfare, it is not proper, it is then figuratiue.</hi> And he adds for an example, a place out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>ye eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud, yee haue no life in you.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Augustine</hi> addeth: <hi>This ſpeech,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſesmeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20181:81"/>a miſchiefe; therefore it is a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſpeech;</hi> vvhereby wee are commanded to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with the ſufferings of Chriſt Ieſus, and with gladnes to keepe in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall memory, that the fleſh of the Lord, was crucified, and wounded for vs. For, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it were more horrible (as the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> maketh mention in the ſecond booke againſt the Aduerſaries of the lavv) to eate the fleſh of Chriſt Ieſus really, then to murther him; and more horrible to drinke his bloud, then to ſhed his bloud. Yet notwithſtanding, they are not aſhamed ſtill to hold &amp; maintaine, that thoſe words ought to be taken properly. So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that of very malice, for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſake, to the end onely that they may withſtand the truth, they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall ſpeech. For they are compelled, will they, nill they, in other ſpeeches of the like ſort, to acknowledge a figure: as, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17.10. Circumciſion is called the Couenant; and <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. the Lamb is called the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer; and <hi>Math.</hi> 20.22. the Cup is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Bloud; and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. the Cup is called the new Teſtament; and 1. Cor. 10.4. the Rock is called Chriſt. All theſe
<pb facs="tcp:20181:82"/>ſpeeches are ſacramentall, and receiue a kinde of interpretation: yet they malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preaſe to deny vs this, in theſe words <hi>(Hoc eſt corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to grant, in the reſt, as eſpecially, where <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the rock, Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now, when they are driuen out of this Fortreſſe, they flie as vnhappily to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: namely, That God by his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, may make the body of Chriſt, both to be in heauen, &amp; in the bread, both at one time. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay they, It is ſo. If I denyed their conſequent, they would bee much troubled to prooue it. But the queſtion ſtandeth not heere, Whether God may do it, or not: but the queſtion is, Whether God will it, or not; or may will it, or not. And we ſay reuerently, that his Maieſtie may not will it: for, though it be true, that hee may many things which hee will not, yet it is as true, that there are many things, vvhich hee may not will; of the which ſort this is: and theſe are reduced to two ſorts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, hee may not will thoſe things vvhich are contrarie to his nature: as to be changeable; as to decay; and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for, if hee might will theſe things,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20181:82"/>they ſhould not be arguments of any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance, or of any power; but rather, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine arguments of his impotencie, and infirmitie. And therefore, though hee may not will theſe things, hee ceaſeth not to be omnipotent; but ſo much the rather, his conſtant and inuincible power is knowen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, GOD may not vvill ſome things, by reaſon of a preſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: as, ſuch things, whereof hee hath concluded the contrarie before; of the vvhich ſort, is this, which is now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. For, ſeeing that GOD hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that a humane bodie, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of inſtrumentall parts, and therefore to be comprehended, and circumſcribed within one, &amp; the owne proper place: and alſo, ſeeing hee hath appointed Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to haue the like bodie; and that, not for a time, but eternally: in reſpect of this determined will (I ſay) God may not will the contrarie, now; either to aboliſh this bodie, which he hath appointed to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or yet to make it at one time, in reſpect of one thing, a body, &amp; not a body, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, &amp; not quantified, finite, and infinite, locall, &amp; not locall: for to wil theſe things,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:83"/>which are plaine contrary in themſelues, he may not, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is poſsible for him to will a lye. So, it may be ſeene of all men, that wee preſerue the omnipotencie of God; &amp; with reuerence from our harts, acknowledge him onely, to be onely om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent: and we deſire all men, to eſteem them as Calumniators, who abuſe the eares of the ſimple ones, to perſwade them the contrary of vs.</p>
            <p>They are not content with this: but they ſay, That God may will a contradiction, &amp; make both the parts to be true at one time. And to proue this, they wold bring in the Miracles which God works: as if they wold ſay, Euery Miracle includes a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for example; God made a Virgine to beare a ſonne, they thinke this vvorke brings with it a contradiction. To beare a ſonne, ſay they, is the one part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; and to be a virgine, is the other part of the contradiction. This worke is a miracle, but it implieth no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for, concerning the holy virgins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, therein is no contradiction. There was a miracle indeed, that a virgine ſhould beare a ſon, contrary to the courſe of nature: for, to be a virgine, and yet to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20181:83"/>haue a child, are not contradictory, if ſhee haue conceiued, and brought forth by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, as did the bleſſed virgin: But to be a virgine, and not a virgine, at one time, this is the contradiction. So Chriſt his body, to be viſible and inuiſible, locall and not locall, at one time, is in euery reſpect the like contradiction; and therefore impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be true.</p>
            <p>Their other example, of Chriſt his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in, the doores beeing cloſed, and ſhut, vvhat appearance of contradiction hath it? Can they proue that hee entred through the doores? And if he did, then was there an alteration of qualities, &amp; that by miracle, either in Chriſt his body, or in the doores; but no contradiction in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vnleſſe you knowe not what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is.</p>
            <p>Their third and laſt example, of the fire in <hi>Nabuchadnezzers</hi> Ouen, which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the miniſters, but hurt not them that were in the midſt of it, appeares to be of no weight, by that which hath already beene anſwered. They imagine, as appeareth, that in euery miracle, a contradiction is implyed: vvhich is abſurd. If they can proue, that this fire was both hot &amp; cold,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:84"/>then they ſay ſomething to the purpoſe: but that it burnes vp ſome, and hurts not others, is no contradiction; becauſe by miracle the force therof was repreſſed. So this ſecond ground is ſure; God may not will that thing, which implyeth a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. But ſo it is, that the reall preſence of the bodie of Chriſt in the Sacrament, implyeth a contradiction; for, it makes the body of Chriſt, viſible, and inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; compaſt, and not compaſt, at one time: therefore, GOD may not will ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>VVhen they are driuen from this they make their laſt refuge a peremptorie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in their owne opinion:
<note place="margin">Their laſt refuge.</note> for, they ſay, Chriſt his bodie is freed from phyſicall rules: for, Theologie is not ſubiect to phyſicall rules. It is a very ill gathered conſequence, to ſay, that vvee ſubiect Theologie to Phyſick, becauſe that vvee (firſt, according to Theologie, vvhich is the law of GOD; and next, according to Phyſicke, vvhich is the law of Nature) defend the naturall properties, of the true, and naturall bodie of Chriſt Iefus. Then I grant this, that Theologie is not ſubiect vnto Phyſick; vvhat of this? <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20181:84"/>his body is freed from phyſicall rules. How followes that I pray you? By vvhat law may yee free, or can yee free the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt? By the law of Nature, yee cannot; for hee was made of the ſeede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and tooke on him true fleſh, of the vvombe of the Virgine: And farre leſſe by the law of GOD, which is Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie: for yee knowe, that Chriſt was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from all eternitie, to take on him our nature, &amp; to becom true man.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is true, that the law of GOD, cannot be ſubiect to the law of Nature; for the law of Nature, floweth from the law of GOD, as out of the owne ſpring: but it is as true, that if yee take Chriſt his body, from the law of Nature, yee ſhall free it alſo from the law of God. For, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the Scripture, ſo conſents with the law of Nature, that if yee denie the one, yee ſhall denie the other; and if yee admit the one, yee ſhall admit alſo the other. Therefore, if they looke vvell about them, they ſhall finde the beame to bee in their ovvne eye: for, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, both the lawe of GOD, and the law of Nature, by a nevv inuented phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of their owne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:85"/>
            <p>For, whatſoeuer he be, that attributes to one, and the ſelfe ſame body, naturall, and vnnaturall properties, vvhich directlie fight againſt themſelues; I ſay, that man peruerts both true Theology, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. But they, to one and the ſelfe ſame body of Chriſt Ieſus, attribute naturall, &amp; vnnaturall properties: therefore it is they, that peruert both the vſe of true Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and the order ſet downe, and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Nature.</p>
            <p>Would you knowe the reaſon of my Propoſition? I ſay, it behoueth as well in Theology, as in Phyſick, of neceſsity, one of the contrary enunciations to be falſe. But once to make an end vvith them, I will aunſwere their laſt refuge. Thus they reaſon; A glorified body, is not ſubiect to phyſicall rules: but Chriſt his body is glorified; therfore it is not ſubiect to phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall rules. Firſt of all, before wee anſwer directly, wee muſt conſider wherein ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the glorification of a body, and then the anſwer will be eaſie.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth after this manner; <hi>So alſo,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>is the reſurrection of the dead. The body is ſowen in corruption, and is raiſed in incorruption:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20181:85"/>It is ſowen in diſhonour, and is raiſed in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. It is ſowen in weakneſſe, and is raiſed in power.</hi> And a litle after: <hi>This corruption, muſt put on incorruption, and this mortalitie, muſt put on immortalitie.</hi> By this cleare <hi>Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Paul</hi> plainly deſcribeth the glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a bodie; for he oppoſeth theſe two, the vnglorified, and the glorified bodie: And to the vnglorified bodie, hee aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth corruption, ignominie, infirmitie, carnalitie, and mortalitie: To the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied bodie, hee attributes incorruption, glorie, power, ſpiritualitie and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: Of this oppoſition, we may gather eaſily, what the reſurrection, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, brings to the bodie. In a word, by them, wee ſee, That the bodie is onely ſpoyled of corruption, ſhame, infirmitie, naturalitie, and mortalitie. And it becomes onely ſpoyled of all the infirmities of our nature, that it may be clothed, with a more glorious apparell: as, with incorruption, power, glorie, ſpiritualitie, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Wee ſee then, That this glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on imports a chaunge indeed; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue no man will bee ſo mad, as to thinke this change to bee made in the ſubſtance: for if that were ſo, the old ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed
<pb facs="tcp:20181:86"/>to decay, and a new ſhould ariſe: but wee heere no ſuch thing in this diſcription, and as little is the change made in the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie: for wee find no word, eyther of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, or diminution of any ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which behoued to be, if it were in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: The moſt that we can perceiue, This mutation conſiſtes in the qualities, by the which, the bodie caſteth off the old coate of infirmitie, and cloatheth it ſelfe, with the coate of glorie: for Chriſt after hee did ariſe, hee both went, and came, was ſeene, and touched. Of the things before deduced, it cleerely followeth, That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the glorie of the bodie of Chriſt, hath wrought nothing in his nature, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and conſequently in his naturall dimenſions, neyther yet in any other eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall propertie, That therefore the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of his bodie, freeth it not, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rules of Phyſick: For, ſo long, as that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a true bodie remaines, there are no ſupernaturall gifts, whereby it may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, were they neuer ſo high, ſo farre as they may be gathered out of the ſcriptures, that may hurt eyther the nature, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall propertie of it: For there is no gift nor qualitie, that may hurt nature,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20181:86"/>but that gift, that is againſt nature. But the ſupernaturall gift, is neyther vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, neyther yet againſt nature: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot hurt, nor impaire nature: And my reaſon is this; Thoſe gifts that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core, and beautifie nature, they cannot hurt, nor impaire nature: But all ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall gifts, beautifie, and decore nature; Therefore, they cannot take away, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, nor yet the naturall property.</p>
            <p>They leaue vs not ſo: but out of this doctrine of <hi>Paule,</hi> concerning the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the bodie, they drawe an obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preſſe vs withall. <hi>Paul</hi> grants, that a glorified bodie, is a ſpirituall bodie: but a ſpirituall bodie, is an inuiſible bodie; Therefore a glorified bodie, is inuiſible: and by conſequence, the bodie of Chriſt is inuiſible.</p>
            <p>Though the argument be not formall: yet to be ſhort, I denie their aſſumption: for if there were no more but that word, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that word might be an argument, that the ſpiritual bodie, is not inuiſible. But yet to open the matter more cleerely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that place: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in a word as it were, in the 44. verſ. of that Chap. ſheweth the change,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:87"/>that ſhall be in the qualities of the bodie, by the reſurrection: For he ſaith, that our naturall bodies, ſhall become ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and then, in the next verſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following, hee expoundeth theſe two qualities: for in the 45. verſe, That is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a naturall bodie ſayeth hee, which is maintained, and quickned by a liuing ſoule onely, ſuch as <hi>Adams</hi> was. And againe, that is ſaid to be a ſpirituall bodie, which together beſides the ſoule, is quickned with a farre more excellent vertue, to wit, with the ſpirit of God, which deſcendeth from Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> vnto vs: Then according vnto this ground, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere with <hi>Auguſtine ad Constantium:</hi> As the naturall bodie is not a ſoule, but a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: Euen ſo, the ſpirituall bodie, is not ſaid to bee a ſoule, but a bodie. And by conſequent, it is not inuiſible:: For the further explaining of this head, I will giue them onely one knot to looſe, and ſo ende this point. Then I reaſon: Yf therefore Chriſts bodie, is naturally, and really in the Lords Supper, becauſe that it is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: It followeth conſequently, That when it was not glorified, it could not bee really preſent. But it was not glorified
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20181:87"/>when this ſupper was firſt inſtituted: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not really preſent in the bread, at Chriſts firſt Supper. Yf his bodie was not really preſent, in the bread, at the firſt ſupper, it cannot be naturally preſent now. For whatſoeuer they vſe now in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of their Supper, or of their Maſſe, (call it as you will) according to their owne confesſion, they vſe it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinance, forme, and maner, that Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe vſed, in his firſt Supper: For they ſay plainely, in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation at <hi>Poysſie,</hi> and in all the reſt of their works, That Chr. Ieſus, firſt, of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that forme, which they vſe in their Maſſe, &amp; left it to his Apoſtles, and to their ſucceſſours, that they ſhould doe the like. And ſo by their owne words, they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled themſelues, and crucified their Maſſe: what can they anſwere to this? They will not ſtand dumbe, I am ſure: for maintenance of their religion, they muſt ſay ſome thing. Thus they ſay, That though the body of Chriſt, which was locally preſent with the reſt of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was not glorified, yet the body which hee exhibited in the bread, was glorified. They might as well haue held their peace,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:88"/>and ſay nothing. For marke the words of the text, as they are written, Luke 22.19. where it is ſaid, <hi>And he tooke the bread, and when hee had giuen thankes, hee brake it, and gaue to them ſaying, This is my bodie, which is giuen for you:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.24. hath theſe words, <hi>Take, eate, this is my bodie, which is broken for you.</hi> This relatiue, which, is relatiue to the bodie, which was exhibited in the bread: for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne confesſion, thoſe words are pronounced vpon the bread, &amp; directed vnto it: But that ſame bodie was giuen, and broken for vs, that is to ſay, crucified, and broken with anguiſh and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. Then I reaſon after this ſort: <hi>To be crucified and broken with anguiſh and dolors, canne no waies agree and conuene, with a glorified bodie: But the bodie that Chriſt exhibited in the bread, is ſaid of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, to be crucified, and broken for vs: Ergo, that bodie was not glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now laſt of all, they are not yet content, but ſay, Chriſt can make the bread his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; And therefore, his bodie is really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. That Chriſt can make the bread his bodie, wee grant: for Chriſt being God, canne doe whatſoeuer hee will: onely let them ſhewe, That Chriſt will make of reall
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20181:88"/>bread, his reall fleſh, and then this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie will ende. Chriſt indeede, makes the bread his bodie, not really, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally: For Chriſt hath not a bodie, made of bread; his bodie was made once of the pure ſubſtance of his bleſſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Another bodie then this, or oftner made then once, hath hee none: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all doctrine that teacheth Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be made of bread, is impious, &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. The Papiſts doctrine of reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, teacheth, That Chriſts bodie in the Sacrament, is made of bread, by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bread, into his bodie; through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration: wherefore we may boldly, and and truly conclude; That their doctrine, of reall preſence, is both wicked, &amp; heretical. Now to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this head: I beſeech them, ſeeing that reaſon fails the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, That they fight not againſt God, for maintenance of a lie, how old ſoeuer it bee (for the diuel is olde enough, &amp; yet he could neuer change his nature) But let them rather glorifie God, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesſing theſe ſpeeches to be Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etal.</p>
            <p>Then what is the reaſon, &amp; ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Papiſts pull downe the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt and the blood of Chriſt, and make the verie ſubſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:89"/>to be corporallie,
<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that moues the Papiſts to thinke that Chr. bodie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be really, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</note> reallie, and ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Sacrament. The reaſon is this, Becauſe they cannot ſee, by their naturall iudgement, nor can vnderſtand, by their natural wit, the truth of this, to wit, how Chriſts fleſh, and blood, can bee preſent in the Sacrament, except hee bee preſent to their corporall hand, to their corporall mouth, and ſtomacke. If they had the light to informe them, That Chriſt might bee preſent, in the Sacrament, and not to the hand, to the mouth, or ſtomack, they would neuer thinke of ſuch a monſtrous preſence, as they imagine to be there. But beeing deſtitute of the ſpirituall light, they follow their naturall reaſons, &amp; make a natural,
<note place="margin">Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> &amp; carnal preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: So that ye haue this leſſon to note from hence: There is no man, that hath not the ſpirit of God, to vnderſtand this word, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> but out of queſtion, hee will doe as the Papiſts doe, that is, hee will vnderſtand it carnally: And ſo they miſ-knowing the right meaning of it, it is no maruaile, though they and we differ in this matter.</p>
            <p>For will you aske of a Papiſt, firſt if the true bodie of Chriſt be there, or if the true fleſh, and blood of Chriſt be there: hee
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20181:89"/>will ſay, it is there:
<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the bodie of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> will you aske him wherein? hee will ſay, in, and vnder the accidents of the bread, &amp; wine, vnder the hew, and roundnes of the bread: will you aske him againe, by what inſtrument it is receiued? Hee will tell you, by the mouth, and ſtomacke, of the bodie: So, this is their groſſe vnderſtanding of the bodie, and blood of Chriſt. Will you aske of the <hi>Vbiquiter,</hi> if the true bodie of Chriſt be preſent? hee will ſay it is: will you aske, if it it be in, with, or vnder the bread? hee will anſwere, it is in the bread, <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuè,</hi> that is, the bread containes it: will you aske him, to what inſtrument, it is offered? hee will anſwere, that the bodie of Chriſt is offered, to the mouth of our bodie, and that the blood of Chriſt, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the mouth of our bodie, as the Papiſts doe: Will you knowe of vs, how Chriſt Ieſus his true bodie, and blood is preſent? wee will ſay, that they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent, really preſent, that is, preſent in the Lords Supper, and not in the bread: wee will not ſay, that his true fleſh is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the hand, or to the mouth of our bodies. But we ſay it is ſpiritually preſent, that is, preſent vnto thy ſpirit, and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:20181:90"/>ſoule: yea, euen as preſent inwardlie, vnto thy ſoule, as the bread, and wine are preſent vnto thy bodie, outwardly: Will you aske then, if the bodie, and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, bee preſent in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? Wee anſwere in a word; They are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but not in the bread and wine, nor in the accidents, nor ſubſtance of bread, and wine. And wee make Chriſt to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this Sacrament, becauſe hee is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to my ſoule, to my ſpirit, and fayth. Alſo, we make him preſent in the Lords Supper, becauſe I haue him in his promiſe, <hi>This is my bodie;</hi> which promiſe, is preſent to my fayth: and the nature of fayth is, to make things, that are abſent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet preſent: And therefore, ſeeing he is both preſent, by fayth in his promiſe, &amp; preſent by the vertue of his holy ſpirit, who can ſay, but that hee is preſent in this Sacrament?</p>
            <p>But yet the word would be explained,
<note place="margin">How a thing is ſaid to be preſent and abſent.</note> what we mean by the word, preſent, how a thing is ſaid to be preſent, &amp; abſent. And knowing this, yee ſhall finde all the matter eaſie. I ſay, things are ſaid to be preſent, as they are perceiued, by anie outward, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe, &amp; as they are perceiued, by any
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20181:90"/>of the ſenſes, ſo are they preſent, &amp; the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be perceiued the further preſent: and by what ſenſe any thing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, to that ſenſe, it is preſent: As if it bee outwardly perceiued, by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe, that thing is outwardly preſent. As for example, if it be perceiued by the outward ſight of the eye, by the outward hearing of the eare, by the outward feeling of the hands or taſte of the mouth, it is outwardly preſent. Or if any thing be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the inward eye, by the inward taſte, &amp; feeling of the ſoule, this thing can not be outwardly preſent, but it muſt bee ſpiritually, &amp; inwardly preſent to the ſoul: So I ſay, euery thing is preſent, as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. So that if you perceiue not a thing outwardly, it is outwardly abſent: and if ye perceiue not a thing inwardly, it is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſent. It is not diſtance of place, that makes a thing abſent, nor propinquitie of place that makes a thing preſent: But it is onely the perceiuing of any thing, by any of thy ſenſes, that makes a thing preſent; &amp; the not perceiuing, that makes a thing abſent: I ſay, though the thing it ſelf were neuer ſo far diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if thou perceiue it by thine outward ſenſe, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto thee. As for example, my body,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:91"/>and the ſunne are as farre diſtant in place, as the heauen is, from the earth; and yet this diſtance ſtayeth not the ſunnes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from mee: why? Becauſe I perceiue the ſunne by mine eie, and other ſenſes; I feele it, and perceiue it by the heate, by the light, and by his brightneſſe: So if a thing were neuer ſo farre diſtant, if wee haue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to perceiue the ſame, it is preſent to vs. Then the diſtance of place, makes not a thing abſent from thee, if thou haſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to perceiueit: likewiſe the neereneſſe of place makes not a thing preſent, be it neuer ſo neere, if thou haſt not ſenſes to perceiue it: As for example, if the ſunne ſhine vpon thine eyes, if thou bee blinde, it is not preſent to thee, becauſe thou canſt not perceiue it. A ſweete tune will neuer be preſent to a deafe eare, though it be ſung in the eare of that man, becauſe hee hath not a ſenſe to perceiue it: And a well told tale, will neuer bee preſent to a foole, becauſe hee cannot vnderſtand it, nor hath no iudgement to perceiue it: So it is not the neereneſſe, nor diſtance of place, that maketh any thing preſent, or abſent, but only the perceiuing, or not perceiuing of it.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:20181:91"/>
            <p>Now the word being made cleere,
<note place="margin">How the bodie of Chriſt is preſent.</note> aske you, how the bodie of Chriſt is preſent? To giue our iudgement in a word, as yee haue heard from time to time, hee is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, not to the outward ſenſes, but to the inward ſenſes, which is fayth, wrought in the ſoule. For this action of the Sacrament, and of the Lords Supper, is partly corporall, and partly ſpirituall: I call this action, partly corporall, not in reſpect onely, that the obiects, that is, That bread, and that wine, are corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but alſo in reſpect, my mouth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto theſe things are offered, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whereby, and the manner how, theſe things are receiued, are all corporal, and naturall: I call the ſame action againe, partly ſpirituall, not onely in reſpect of Chriſt Ieſus, who is the heauenly, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing of the Sacrament, but alſo in reſpect of my ſoule, whereunto, Chr. is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and giuen, in reſpect the inſtrument whereby, and the manner how, hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, are all ſpirituall: for I get not Chriſt corporally, but ſpiritually: So in theſe reſpect, I call this action, partly corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and partly ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>Now, confounde not theſe two ſorts of
<pb facs="tcp:20181:92"/>actions, The corporall, and naturall ſignes, with the ſpirituall thing, ſignified thereby: againe, confound not the mouth of the bodie, with the mouth of the ſoule. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, confound not the outwarde manner of receuing, by the hand of the bodie, with the ſpirituall manner of receiuing, by the hand of the ſoule: And ſo it ſhall bee exceeding cleere to ſee, that each thing ſhall bee preſent, to the owne inſtrument; that is, The bodie of Chriſt, which is the ſpirituall thing ſignified, ſhall be preſent to the ſpirituall mouth, and hand: and the bread, and wine, which are the corporall ſignes, are preſent to the corporall mouth and hand. Then how is any obiect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? A corporall obiect, is corporally preſent: and an inward obiect, is inwardly preſent. Of what nature is the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? It is of an heauenly nature. Then aske you, how is he preſent; He is ſpiritually, and heauenly preſent to the ſoule, and the mouth of the ſoule, which is faith, For it were a prepoſterous thing, to make the thing ſignified preſent to thy belly, or to the mouth or eye of thy body; for if that were ſo, it ſhould not be ſpiritually preſent: becauſe euery thing is preſent as it agreeth in it owne nature. Is it a bodily thing? it is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20181:92"/>bodily preſent: &amp; if it be a heauenly thing, it is ſpiritually preſent: So I thinke no man can doubt, how the bodie of Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: hee is not carnally preſent, but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent to my ſoule, and to faith, in my ſoule: Thus far concerning the manner of his preſence.</p>
            <p>Now the laſt part of our difference is this:
<note place="margin">The laſt point in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twixt vs, and the Papiſts.</note> wee haue to conſider to whom the words ought to be directed, &amp; pronounced: For we &amp; the Papiſts differ in this laſt point; we ſay, that the words ought to be directed, &amp; pronounced vnto the people, to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full communicants. They on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſay, that the words ought not to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, nor pronounced to the people, but to the elements, &amp; not to be cleerly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but whiſpered on the elements; So that if they be ſpoken to the people, or ſpoken openly, their charme auailes not. Now, I ſay, that as this holy action, is peruerted by them in all the reſt, ſo they peruert it in this point alſo, in ſpeaking that, to the dumbe elements, which they ſhould ſpeak to the people of God: For, I ſhall proue it cleerely, by three arguments taken out of the Scriptures, that the words ought not to be ſpoken, to the bread, but to the people of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:93"/>
            <p>And firſt I ſay, The promiſes of mercie and grace, ought to be directed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to them, in whom the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms them, &amp; makes them effectual: But ſo it is, That the promiſes of mercie and grace, are performed, and made effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, not in bread, and wine, but in fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men &amp; women: Therefore theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhould be directed, to faythfull men &amp; women. Now here is the promiſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; grace: <hi>This is my bodie which is broken for you:</hi> and this promiſe is made to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but to the faithfull, and ſo to them onely, it ought to bee directed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee haue to conſider, That this Sacrament, ſeales vp a couenant of grace, and mercie. Now, with whom will God make his couenant of mercy, and grace? will hee make a couenant with a peece of bread, or any dumbe element: There is no man will enter into couenant with his ſeruant; much leſſe, will enter into coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a dumbe element: So in reſpect this Sacrament ſeales vp a couenant, this couenant, of necesſitie, muſt bee made with a faithfull ſoule, and in no wiſe with the dumbe element: and therefore, theſe wordes cannot bee directed to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20181:93"/>elements. Thirdly, looke to the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Sacrament vvas appointed. Is it not to lead vs to Chriſt? Is it not to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh my faith in Chriſt? Is it not to nouriſh me in a conſtant perſwaſion, of the Lords mercy in Chriſt? Was this Sacrament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make the elements, Gods? No: for if ye marke Gods purpoſe in this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, yee ſhall finde, that Chriſt hath not ordained this inſtitution, to nobilitate the Elements, to fauour and reſpect the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were Bread, and Wine, ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, to be Gods to day. Wee on the contrary, ſay plainely, that the inſtitution of Chriſt, reſpecteth not the elements, to alter their nature. Indeed, it is appointed to alter vs, to change vs, and to make vs more and more ſpirituall, and to ſanctifie the elements to our vſe. But the ſpeciall end, is this, To make vs holie, and more &amp; more to growe vp, in a ſure faith in Chriſt, and not to alter the Elements, nor to make them gods. And therefore, by all theſe three Arguments, it is euident, that the words ought not to be directed to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to the people, and faithfull Communicants.</p>
            <p>Now, to come to an end: There is one
<pb facs="tcp:20181:94"/>thing,
<note place="margin">Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> without the which wee cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, let vs diſcourſe neuer ſo long vpon the right vnderſtanding of the Sacrament. Ye ſee now, how all that is ſpoken concerning the Sacrament, is grounded, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon faith. Let a man haue faith, be it neuer ſo little, hee ſhall get ſome hold of Chriſt, and ſome inſight, in the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Sacrament: but wanting faith, though a man endeuour himſelfe to make the Sacraments neuer ſo ſenſible, it is not poſsible that hee can gette any hold of Chriſt, or any inſight of him. For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, we cannot be Chriſtians: we can neither get a ſight of God, nor feele God in Chriſt, without faith.</p>
            <p>Faith is the onely thing, that tranſlates our ſoules, out of that death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vvherein vvee vvere conceiued and borne, and planteth life in vs. So, the vvhole ſtudie, and endeuour of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſhould tend to this; To craue, that the Lord in his mercie, vvould illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his minde vvith the eye of faith, and that hee would kindle in his heart, a loue of faith, and vvorke in his hart, a thirſt, and deſire of the obiect of faith, &amp; more and more, to thirſt, and hunger, for the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20181:94"/>foode of faith, that nouriſhes vs to life eternall.</p>
            <p>Without this faith, (hovv-ſoeuer the naturall man, vnderſtanding naturally, would flatter himſelfe) ſurely, there is no bleſſedneſſe; but all his life is more then terrible miſery. For, what-ſoeuer it be that flatters, and pleaſeth thee now, be it a thought, or motion of the minde, or an action of the body, that pleaſeth thee now, without faith; the ſame very motion, cogitation, or action, ſhall torment thee heereafter.</p>
            <p>So, vvithout faith, it is not poſsible to pleaſe GOD; and vvhatſoeuer pleaſeth not GOD, is done to torment thee: Therefore craue mercie, for whatſoeuer motion, cogitation, or action, vvherein thou haſt offended GOD; or, for the ſame, God ſhall offend, and torment thee. And to eſchevv the offence of God, there is no meanes, but by true faith; therefore the ſtudie of a Chriſtian ſhould be, to grow in faith.</p>
            <p>Now, by hearing of the vvord, thou getteſt faith; and by receiuing this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou obtaineſt the increaſe of faith; and hauing faith, the receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb facs="tcp:20181:95"/>ſhall be fruitfull: but, vvithout faith, thou eateſt thineowne condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then the whole ſtudy of a Chriſtian is, to get faith; and this faith cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with idleneſſe, but by earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: therefore, let euery one of vs fall downe, and craue earneſtly this faith, and the increaſe of it, whereby we may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiuers of this bleſſed Sacrament; and that for the righteous merits of Chriſt Ieſus. To whom, with the Father, and the holy Spirit, be all honour, praiſe, and glory, both now, and euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THough the doctrine of our triall, and due examination (well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Chriſt Ieſus) ought to goe before the doctrine, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacrament: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſeeing that preparation is alwaies, at all times, as well neceſſary for the hearing of the ſimple word, as for the receiuing of the viſible Sacrament; (for no man can heare the word of God fruitfully, except in ſome meaſure he prepare his ſoule, and prepare the eares of his hart, how to hear) therefore the doctrine of preparation, and due examination, muſt come in it ovvne
<pb facs="tcp:20181:96"/>place, and be very neceſſary for cuery one of you. The Apoſtle, in the words vvhich we haue read, deliuereth his counſaile, and giueth his aduiſe; and not onely giues his aduiſe, but giues his admonition, and commaund, That we ſhould not come to the Table of the Lord, That we ſhould not come to the hearing of the word, raſhly: but that euery one of vs, ſhould come to this holy worke, with reuerence; that wee ſhould prepare, and ſanctifie our ſelues in ſome meaſure.

In a word, hee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the whole doctrine, and matter of this preparation, when he ſaith; <hi>Let euery man, and let euery woman, try and examine themſelues.</hi> As if he would ſay, <hi>Let euery one of you, try and examine your ſoules.</hi> That is, try the eſtate of your owne harts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of your owne conſciences. Marke and behold, in vvhat eſtate you heart is with GOD, and in what eſtate your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is with your neighbour.</p>
            <p>He bids not your neighbour to try you, hee bids not your companion to try your hart; but he biddes your ſelfe, in perſon, to try your owne conſcience; hee biddes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20181:96"/>your ſelfe, try your owne hart; becauſe none can be certaine of the eſtate of your hart, or of the condition of your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now, he excludes not others from the tryall of you neither (for it is lawfull for the Paſtor to try you) but others cannot try you ſo narrowly, as ye your ſelues may; for no man can know ſo much of mee, as I know of my ſelfe. No man can be certaine of the eſtate of your hart, and condition of your conſcience; &amp; yet you your ſelues may be certaine of it. As for others, men may iudge of your hart, and conſcience, according to your works, and effects; and except your works &amp; effects bee very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and altogether vitious, we are bound in conſcience, to iudge charitably of your harts and conſciences. Therefore, there is none ſo meet to try the ſpirit of a man, to try the hart, or conſcience of a man, as is the man himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">The heads to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Sermons.</note> that this tryall may be the better made, ye haue firſt to vnderſtand what it is that ye ſhould try: What ye call a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the Apoſt. commands you to try. Next, ye are to conſider, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; cauſes ye ſhold try your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:97"/>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſt of all; ye are to knowe in what chiefe points yee ſhould try, and examine your conſciences. Then, that wee ſpeake not vnto you of things vnknowen, it is neceſſary for euery one of you (ſeeing there is none of you that lacketh a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) to vnderſtand what a conſcience is: and as neerely as GOD ſhall giue mee grace, I will bring you to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and knowledge of a conſcience.</p>
            <p>I call a conſcience,
<note place="margin">Definition of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paits therof.</note> a certaine feeling in the hart, reſembling the iudgement of the liuing GOD, following vpon a deed done by vs, flowing from a knowledge in the minde, accompanied with a certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hart, to wit, feare, or ioy, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or reioycing. Now, we will examine the parts of this definition. I call it firſt of all, a certaine feeling in the hart; for, the Lord hath left ſuch a ſtampe in the hart of euery man, that he doth not that thing ſo ſecretly, nor ſo quietly, but hee makes his owne hart to ſmite him, and to ſtrike him: hee makes him to feele in his owne hart, whether he hath done well, or ill.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath placed this feeling in the hart; why? Becauſe the eyes of God, looke not ſo much vpon the outward counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20181:97"/>and exterior behauiour, as vpon the inward hart. For he ſaith to <hi>Samuel,</hi> in the firſt booke, 16.7. <hi>The Lord beholds the hart.</hi> So, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. hee ſaith to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, The Lord ſearcheth all harts, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands all imaginations, and thoughts.</hi> Alſo <hi>Ieremy</hi> 11.20. <hi>The Lord tries the reins and the hart.</hi> And the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſhall lighten things that are hid in darknes, and make the counſels of the hart manifeſt.</hi> So, in reſpect that the Lord will chiefely haue to doe with the heart, therefore in the hart hee placeth this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is the chiefe part of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>I ſay next, that this feeling reſembleth the iudgement of God: for, this feeling was left, and placed in our ſoules for this end and purpoſe, that we might haue a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall, and familiar iudgement within our ſelues, to reſemble, and deſcribe, the ſecret, and inuiſible iudgement of the high God; A particular iudgement, to goe before that generall iudgement, in that generall and great day, where euery man ſhal be iuſtified, or condemned, according to the particular iudgement, that is within his owne conſcience. In the meane time,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:98"/>this conſcience is left in vs, to arreſt vs in this life; thereby, as it were, to eaſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, at that laſt Iudgement. For the bookes of our own conſciences, in that laſt day ſhal be opened; &amp; euery man ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, according to the report of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that is within his ovvne conſcience: therefore I ſay, that our conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the iudgement of GOD.</p>
            <p>The third thing that I ſay, is this; It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vpon a deed done by vs: our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor our hart ſtrikes vs not, before the deede be done; our hart ſtrikes vs not, before the euill deed be committed: no, it goes not before the deed; but the ſtroke of the conſcience, and feeling of the hart, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes immediatly vpon the deed, in ſuch ſort, that the deed is no ſooner done by thee, but thy conſcience applyes it to thy ſelf, and giues out the ſentence againſt thy ſelfe: therefore, I ſay, It is a feeling, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vpon a deede done by vs.</p>
            <p>And next I ſay, flowing from a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the minde; for except the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience haue information, and except the heart knovve, that the deede vvhich is done, is euill; the hart, nor the conſcience can neuer count it to be euill: therefore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20181:98"/>knowledge muſt goe before the ſtroke of the conſcience: thy hart can neuer feele that to be euill, which thy minde knoweth not to be euill.</p>
            <p>So, knowledge muſt euer goe before feeling, and according to the meaſure of thy knowledge, according to the nature, and qualitie of thy knowledge, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall the teſtimonie and ſtroke of thy conſcience be. For a light knowledge, a doubting, and vncertaine knowledge, makes a light, and ſmall ſtroke: as on the other part, a holy and ſolid knowledge, drawne out of the word of God, maketh a heauy ſtroke of the conſcience. So the conſcience muſt anſwere to the knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If we haue no other knowledge, but the knowledge which wee haue by nature, and by the light &amp; ſparks which are left in nature, our conſcience will anſwer no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to that knowledge: but if beſide the light of nature, we haue a knowledge of God in his word, &amp; a knowledge of God by his holy ſpirit, working in our harts; our coſciences wil then go further, &amp; excuſe, or accuſe vs, according vnto the light that is in the word. So that the conſcience is not acquired, or obtained, at what time we are
<pb facs="tcp:20181:99"/>enlightened, by the working of the holie Spirit, and hearing of the word of GOD: but, our conſcience is borne with vs, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to vs, and is left in the ſoule of euery man &amp; woman: &amp; as there are ſome ſparks of light left in nature, ſo there is a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence left in it; and if there were no more, that ſame light that is left in thy nature, ſhall be enough to condemne thee. So, the conſcience is not gotten, or begun at the hearing of the word, or at that time, when we begin to reforme our ſelues, by the aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and renuing of the holy Spirit: but euery man by nature hath a conſcience, &amp; the Lord hath left it in our nature; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that this conſcience be reformed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God, that ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſcience ſhall be enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee eternally: therefore, I ſay, flowing from a knowledge of the minde. Laſt of all, I ſay, accompanied with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine motion of the hart: and wee expreſſe this motion, in feare, or ioy, trembling, or reioycing. In very great feare, if the deede be exceeding heynous, and the ſtroke of the conſcience be very heauy; then the conſcience neuer taketh reſt, for guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will euer dread. But if the deede be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20181:99"/>honeſt, godly, and commendable, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a glad hart, and maketh the hart euen to burſt out into ioy. So, to bee ſhort in this matter (for I purpoſe not to make a common place of it) yee ſee, that in euerie conſcience, there muſt be two things: Firſt, there muſt be a knowledge; &amp; next, there muſt be a feeling: whereby, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy knowledge, thou applyeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thine owne hart, the deed done by thee. So that, as the word it ſelfe teſtifieth, it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of two parts: of knowledge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereunto it is called ſcience; and of feeling, according whereunto, the <hi>Con</hi> is added, and it is called Conſcience. Then the word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, ſignifieth knowledge, with application.</p>
            <p>This conſcience,
<note place="margin">To what v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the conſcience to ſerue in the ſoule of of man.</note> the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſerue in the ſoule of man, for many vſes: to wit, he hath appointed euery one of your conſciences, to be a keeper, a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on, a carefull attender vpon euery ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion done by you. So that, that action can not be, ſo ſecretly, ſo quietly, nor ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueied, but will thou, nill thou, thy conſcience ſhall beare a teſtimonie of it; thy conſcience ſhall be a faithfull obſeruer of it; and one day, ſhall bee a faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder
<pb facs="tcp:20181:100"/>of that action. So, the Lord hath appointed thy conſcience to this office, that it attends; and waits vpon thee in all thy actions.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Likewiſe, the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thy conſcience, and placed it in thy ſoule, to be an accuſer of thee; ſo that when thou dooſt any euill deed, thou haſt a domeſticall accuſer within thine ovvne ſoule,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to finde fault with it. Hee hath alſo placed it in thy ſoule, to be a true and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt witneſſe againſt thee; yea, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the conſcience, reſembles not onely a teſtimony, or witneſſe; but the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is as good as tenne thouſand witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The conſcience alſo is left in the ſoule, to doe the part of a Iudge againſt thee, to giue out ſentence againſt thee, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee: and ſo it doth; for our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular iudgement, muſt goe before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, &amp; vniuerſall iudgement of the Lord at that great day.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And what more? Hee hath left thy conſcience within thee, to put thine owne ſentence in execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy ſelfe. This is terrible: hee hath left it within thee, to be a very torture, and tormenter to thy ſelfe; and ſo to put thine owne ſentence in execution vpon thy ſelfe. Is not this a matter more then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20181:100"/>that one, and the ſelfe ſame conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhall ſerue to ſo many vſes in a ſoule; as to be a continuall obſeruer, and marker of thy actions; an accuſer; tenne thouſand vvitneſſes; a Iudge; a Sergeant, and Tormentor; to execute thine ovvne ſentence againſt thy ſelfe? ſo that the Lord needs not to ſeeke a Sergeant, out of thine owne ſoule to arreſt thee, for thou ſhalt haue all theſe within thy ſelfe, to make a plaine declaration againſt thy ſelfe. Take heede to this: for there is neuer a word of this ſhall fall to the ground; but either yee ſhall finde it to your comfort, or to your euerlaſting woe. And this ſecret, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular iudgement, that euery one of you carries about you, abideth ſo ſure, and ſo faſt within you, that do what ye can, if yee would imploy your whole trauaile to blot it out, thou ſhalt neuer get it ſcraped out of thy ſoule. If ye were as malicious, and were becom as wicked, as euer any incarnate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell vvas vpon the earth, yet ſhall yee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer get this conſcience altogether extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed out of thy ſoule: but will thou, nill thou, there ſhall as much remaine of it, as ſhal make thee inexcuſable in the great day of the generall Iudgement.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:101"/>
            <p>I grant, thou maiſt blot out all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge out of thy minde, and make thy ſelfe become euen as a blinde man. I grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that thou maiſt harden thy hart, ſo that thou wilt blot out all feeling out of it, ſo that thy conſcience will not accuſe thee, nor finde fault with thee, but thou ſhalt haue a delight in dooing euill, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a remorſe: but I deny, that any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of wickednes in the earth, ſhall bring thee to this poynt, that thou maiſt do euill without feare; but ſtill, the more that thou dooſt euill, and the longer that thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueſt in euill dooing, thy feare ſhall bee the greater: yea, in deſpight of the diuell, &amp; in deſpight of all the malice of the hart of man, thy feare ſhall remaine. And though they would both conſpire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhall not be able to baniſh that feare, but that gnawing of the conſcience, ſhal euer remaine, to teſtifie, that there is a day of Iudgement. I grant alſo, that there ſhall be a viciſsitude, and that feare ſhall not alwayes remaine, but ſhall be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turned into ſecuritie; neyther ſhall that ſecurity alwayes abide, but ſhal be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe into feare: ſo that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to get this feare wholly extinct; but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20181:101"/>the greater that the ſecuritie is, the greater ſhall thy feare be, when thou art wakened. Thirdly, I grant, that this feare ſhall bee blinde; for from that time, a man by euill dooing, hath baniſhed knowledge out of the minde, and feeling out of the heart, what can remaine there, but a blind feare? When men haue put out all light, and left nothing in their nature, but darkneſſe, there can nothing remaine but a blinde feare. So I grant, that the feare is blinde: for neither knowe they from whence that feare commeth, vvhat progreſſe it hath, whereunto it tendeth, where, nor when, it ſhall end: therefore, they that are this way miſledde in their ſoules, or all men in the earth, they are moſt miſerable. For as long as thou maiſt keep in thy mind, a ſpark of this knowledge, &amp; ſpirituall light, in the which thou maiſt ſee the face of GOD in Chriſt, wherein thou maiſt ſee a remedy, in the death and paſsion of Chriſt, &amp; wherein thou maiſt ſee the bowels of mercy, offred in the bloud of Chriſt; if thou haue anie ſparke of this light (albeit it were neuer ſo little) to direct thee, and albeit this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were neuer ſo much wounded, yet there is mercy enough for thee in Chriſt:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:102"/>but if thou cloſe vp all the windowes of thy ſoule, and of thy hart, and make them to become palpable darknes, that thou ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the terror comes, nor yet perceiueſt any remedy, that is the miſery of all miſeries.</p>
            <p>We haue many things in generall to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning the eſtate of this our Country,
<note place="margin">Applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> wherein we liue. Alſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is not one of you, but haue great cauſe to take heed to your conſciences now, while yee haue time; that yee baniſh not altogether this light, which is yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto you, and whereof ſome ſparks yet remain. For I ſee the moſt part of men, runne headlong to baniſh the ſparke of light that is in them, and will not reſt, ſo long as there is any ſparke of it left, vntill it be vtterly baniſhed. And when they haue done ſo, alas, what can follow, but a blinde and terrible feare in their conſciences, vvhich they can neuer get extinguiſhed; a feare vvithout remedie; a growing feare, and not a decaying feare; a feare that will deuoure them wholly at the laſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, euery one of you be carefull of this light that is within you; take heede, that the foule affections of your harts, dravve
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20181:102"/>not your bodies after them; ſee, at the leaſt, that thoſe affections baniſh not this light. And, ſo long as the Lord offers you this light, in time craue, that of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, hee vvould giue you the grace to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, to take a nevv courſe, and yet to amend your liues, vvhile time is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you.</p>
            <p>The body ſhall leaue the ſoule, and the ſoule ſhall leaue the bodie; but the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall neuer leaue the ſoule: but vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo-euer the ſoule goeth, to the ſame place ſhall the conſcience repaire; and looke in vvhat eſtate thy conſcience is, when thou departeſt out of this life, in the ſelfe ſame eſtate ſhall it meet thee in the great Day. So that if thy conſcience was a tormentor to thee at the time of thy death, if thou gette it not then pacified, it ſhall be alſo a tormentor to thee, in that generall Iudgement. Therefore, this matter vvould bee vvell vveighed, and euerie one of you ſhould ſtudie to haue a good conſcience, that vvhen the ſoule is ſeuered from the body, leauing your conſcience at reſt, and peace with God, it may be reſtored vnto you, &amp; meet you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, with as great peace and quietnes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:103"/>
            <p>Thus farre concerning conſcience, what it is. I beſeech the liuing Lord, ſo to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your memories, that ye may keep theſe things; and that euery one of theſe things may be ſo imprinted in your harts, that ye may be mindful of them, all your liues.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that we are to ſpeake of, is this: We are to conſider wherfore we ſhould try our conſciences; for what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we ſhould examine our own ſoules and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences. I wil declare the reaſons brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It behooueth euery one of you to try your conſcience. Why? Becauſe the Lord will make his reſidence, in no other part of the ſoule, but in the conſcience: Hee hath appointed his dwelling to be in the hart of man, and in the will, and conſcience of man; and therefore it becomes you, to make his dwelling place cleane, &amp; to take heeed vnto your harts.</p>
            <p>Next; though the Lord of heauen made not his reſidence there: yet, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the eye of GOD is an all-ſeeing eye, and able to pearce throgh the very thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mans fleſh, how darke and groſſe ſoeuer it be, and to enter into the very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corners of thy conſcience; (for vnto the all-ſeeing eye of GOD, the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20181:103"/>corner of the conſcience, is as cleare and manifeſt, as any outward, or bodily thing in the earth, can be to the outward eye of the body): In reſpect therefore that this eye is ſo pearcing, and that hee caſts his eye onely vpon our harts, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth vs to try our harts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hee is the Lord of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There is no Monarch on earth, that hath any ſoueraigntie or lordſhippe ouer the conſcience: onely the GOD of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, onely Chriſt Ieſus, King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, is Lord of the conſcience, hee hath power onely to ſaue and loſe. Therefore, vvhen thou commeſt to this Sacrament of the Lords Table, thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt carefully to looke vnto thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to try and examine the ſtate of it.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, vvhich is a chiefe reaſon; It behooueth thee to prooue thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe the welfare and health of thy ſoule, dependeth vpon thy conſcience. If thy conſcience that is within thy ſoule, be well, if it be at peace and reſt, thy ſoule is vvell; if thy conſcience be in a good eſtate, thy ſoule muſt needs be in a good eſtate; if thy conſcience bee in good health, of neceſsity thy ſoule muſt be in
<pb facs="tcp:20181:104"/>good health; for the good health, &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of the ſoule, dependes vpon a good conſcience: therefore, it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth euery one of you, to try well your conſciences.</p>
            <p>There vvas neuer any lavv made, or deuiſed, that forbade vs to haue a care of our healths; it is lawfull for vs to ſeeke ſuch things as may procure, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it: but the health of thy ſoule, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the health of thy conſcience, and in preſeruing thereof: therefore, by all lawes, thou oughteſt to attend thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. If thou keepe thy conſcience wel, thy ſoule is in health; and if thy ſoule be in health, let troubles come what will vpon thy bodie, thou wilt indure them all; but if thy ſoule be diſeaſed with an euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, thou ſhalt not be able to beare out the leaſt trouble that ſhall come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy bodie: vvhereas, if the conſcience were at reſt, and in good health, that trouble could not happen vnto thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but the ſtrength of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vvould beare it out. Then haue yee not reaſon, and more then reaſon, to take heed to your conſciences, to try, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your conſciences, in vvhat eſtate
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20181:104"/>and diſpoſition they ſtand?</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">Certaine leſſons to be learned, by which a man may preſerue health in his ſoule &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> becauſe it is a fruitleſſe thing to tell you, that health is neceſſarie, and not to ſhew the vvay how this health may be obtayned and preſerued; therfore to keep your conſciences in quiet, &amp; good health, I will giue you theſe few leſſons. Firſt of all, bee ſure, that yee retaine ſtedfaſt, a perſwaſion of the mercie of GOD, in Chriſt Ieſus; examine vvhen thou lyeſt downe, and examine when thou riſeſt vp, in what eſtate thou art with God; whether thou maiſt looke for mercy at his hands, or not.</p>
            <p>Art thou perſwaded of mercy? Aſſure thy ſelfe thy conſcience is in a good eſtate, thou haſt health in thy ſoule; for, by the keeping of faith, the conſcience is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. Keepe this perſwaſion, preſerue it vvhole and ſound, hurt it not, bring not thy ſoule into doubting, ſtay not, nor hinder thy perſwaſion, if thou deſire to keep health in thy ſoule: for, if thou doubt, or any way diminiſh thy perſwaſion, and aſſurance, aſſuredlie, thy aſſurance cannot ſo ſoon be hindered, nor diminiſhed, but at that very inſtant, ſhall follow the diminiſhing of the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:105"/>health of thy ſoule; yea, it cannot be, but in that very article of time, ſhall follow the hurt of thy conſcience; for faith will not dwell, but in a whole conſcience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at what time thou dooſt any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy conſcience, at that very time, thou loſeſt a degree of thy perſwaſion of the mercy of God: and vntill ſuch time as thou fall downe at the feet of Chriſt, and obtaine mercie for that wicked deed, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe peace at his hands, and repaire thy perſvvaſion, thou ſhalt euer doubt of mercie, and vvant health in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Then this is the firſt leſſon, to keepe health in your ſoules, To be perſwaded of mercie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond leſſon to keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or to keepe health in thy ſoule, is this; Yee muſt flie, eſchew, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, vvhatſoeuer may trouble the health of your ſoule, whatſoeuer may trouble the quietneſſe, &amp; peaceable eſtate of your conſcience: caſt it out, forbeare it, and eſchew it. This generall is good. But let vs ſee vvhat it is that troubles the quiet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the conſcience. Onely ſinne; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an euill nature. Therefore vvee muſt of neceſsitie, to keepe health in our
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20181:105"/>ſoules, forbeare and eſchew ſinne; we muſt flie and auoyde ſin. It is not poſsible, that ye can both keepe a good conſcience, and ſerue the affections of your hart: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to keepe peace &amp; health in thy ſoule, thou muſt take leaue of thy luſts; thou muſt renounce the luſts, and affections of thy hart, and thou muſt not doe as thou waſt wont to doe: thou muſt not be giuen to the ſeruice of thine affections, and of thine appetite, to put them in execution, as thou haſt formerly done. But in-caſe thine affections, or luſt commaund thee to doe any thing, what is thy part? Thou muſt try, how far this may ſtand with the good will of God; and how far that affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which commaunds thee, may agree with the law of God. Is there ſuch a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, as that, that thing which thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection commaunds thee, may ſtand with Gods law, and holy will? Then no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is a ſanctified affection, thou maiſt put it in execution. But after this tryall, if thou finde thine affections to be exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, &amp; out of rule, carying thee from God, &amp; againſt his law, beware of it, reſiſt it, put it not in execution; for if thou fulfill the will of thine affections, what pleaſure can it
<pb facs="tcp:20181:106"/>bring with it? It may well bring a flattering pleaſure in the entrie, but it cloſeth euer with a bitter remorſe in the end. Then to eſchew this bitter remorſe, ſhould yee not all try your affections? Yee muſt examine and try them by the ſquare of Gods lavv; yee muſt ſee how farre they agree with his law, and how fatre they diſſent from it; &amp; ſo farre as they are diſſonant from that law, let euery man deny himſelfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his affections: and ſo, this triall beeing taken in this manner, by thy ſelfe, it ſanctifieth thine affections, maketh Chriſt to lodge in thy ſoule, maketh thy conſcience to be at reſt. And the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit this way, maketh both bodie, and ſoule, to bee in good health, and to reioyce. Then flie from ſinne. This is the ſecond leſſon.</p>
            <p>The third leſſon is this; Studie to doe well. Wouldeſt thou keepe health in thy ſoule? Study to do better and better conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually: At the leaſt, haue a purpoſe in thy ſoule &amp; hart, to doe better daily; which is the laſt leſſon. Seeing that when we ſtudie to do beſt, &amp; that the iuſt man, that is, the moſt holy man, falleth ſo often as 7. times a day, yea rather, 70. times ſeauen times,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20181:106"/>what is thy part in theſe ſlips, and ſnares? Though thou fal, as thou canſt not eſchew to fall, lie not ſtill there; ſleepe not there where thou haſt faln: it is a ſhame to ſleepe there, therefore ariſe againe. And hovv ſhouldeſt thou riſe? By lifting vp thy ſoule, and running to the Fountaine of grace and mercy; by repayring to Chriſt Ieſus, to obtaine mercy for thy ſoule; and to craue, that hee would ſend out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that meaſure of peace, that may put thy conſcience at reſt, &amp; reſtore thy ſoule to health. So, lie not where thou falleſt, but incontinent ariſe, &amp; craue mercy; and in obtayning mercy, thou ſhalt repaire thy fal, thou ſhalt amend thy life by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, &amp; by repentance thou ſhalt get peace, thou ſhalt haue thy conſcience at reſt, and get health to thy ſoule. Now keep this rule, if thou deſireſt to keepe thy ſoule in health: look that thou ſleep not in ſinne, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did: lie not ſtill vvhen thou art faln, and ſo fall from one ſinne, to another; as from adultery, to murther, from murther, to the next, &amp;c. As commonly, if a man ſleepe in ſin, and riſe not in time, one ſin wil draw on another; for there is no ſin alone, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the greater, and more heynous that
<pb facs="tcp:20181:107"/>the ſinne is, it hath the greater, and worſe ſinnes wayting on it. Therefore, when yee fall, delay not to ariſe, but repaire to the fountaine of mercie, and ſeeke grace in time: runne to prayer, run to the Church of God, whereſoeuer it be, whether in the fielde, or in the towne: runne to Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and craue mercy of him, that yee may haue peace in your conſciences; and ſo by theſe meanes, euery one of you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue health in your ſoules. By theſe meanes, ye ſhall learne what difference is, betwixt this liuing word of mercy, and grace, which ſounds in our religion; and that ſlaying letter, that kills the ſoule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that heares it; I meane that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous doctrine, of that dumbe Maſs.</p>
            <p>I mention this vnto you, becauſe I ſee, that many in theſe dayes are fallen to it, and the Lord is beginning to abſtract his grace, and mercy from this Country, for the contempt of this quickning vvord, which hath ſo cleerely ſounded heere, &amp; which our country-men, for the greateſt part (running headlong to the diuell in a dumbe guiſe) trauaile vtterly to baniſh. Is not this a miſerable thing, that ſo fevv of you haue eyes to conſider, and diſcerne,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20181:107"/>of the time of peace, mercy, and grace, which is ſo aboundantly offred? The Lord of his mercy, giue you eyes in time.</p>
            <p>Thus far concerning the reaſons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery one of you ſhould try and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your owne conſciences: and this triall ought not to be for a day, or for a yeere; but it ought to be euery day, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere of thy whole life. For that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that ſhould reſt for euer with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, that conſcience, which muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer behold the face of the Sonne of God, it cannot be ouer-well cleanſed; wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke ouer-narrowly to it. The more curious we be in ſearching out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, we are the better occupied: I ſpeak of our own conſciences, I ſpeak not of our neighbours.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I come to the points,
<note place="margin">In what points wee ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our conſciences.</note> wherein euery one of you ſhould try and examine your ſelues. Euery one of you ought to try &amp; examine your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences in two things: Firſt, whether thou be at peace with God, who is the Lord of heauen, or not. Next, examine thy conſcience, whether thou art in loue &amp; amity with thy neighbor, or not. Wouldeſt thou know, whether thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be at vnity &amp; peace with God, or not?
<pb facs="tcp:20181:108"/>Thou ſhalt know it this way; The God of heauen, can haue no ſocietie nor compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with that ſoule, which is alwaies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, that is euery way defiled; no, hee cannot.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſpeake not ſo preciſely, that I make a ſoule to be fully ſanctified, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy in this life: no, in this life, there are wonderfull iniquities, groſſe ſinnes, &amp; great faults, where-with, euen the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are defiled: but this is my meaning; There is no ſoule can be at any peace with God, or wherewith the Lord can haue any ſocietie, but in ſome meaſure it muſt bee ſanctified, and made holy. For God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make reſidence in a ſoule, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies as a ſlinking dunghill; and therfore of force, in ſome meaſure it muſt be ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: there muſt be ſo much made cleane in one corner, or other, of that ſoule, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord of heauen, by his holy Spirit, may make his reſidence.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs ſee wherby the ſoule is ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 15.9. ſaith, That the ſoule of man is purified by faith; that the hart of man is purged by faith. So, faith openeth and purgeth the hart. By faith in Chr. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and in the merits of his bloud, we haue
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20181:108"/>peace with God: <hi>Beeing iuſtified by faith, we haue peace towards God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Now then, this point commeth in, That yee are to proue your ſelues, whether ye be in the faith, or not; as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Proue your ſelues, vvhether ye are in the faith.</hi> Examine if your ſoules be ſeaſoned with this faith; for if ye haue not faith in Chriſt, Chriſt is not in you; and if Chriſt be not in you, yee are in an euill ſtate, ye are in the eſtate of the reprobate, and damned. So euery one ought to looke carefully, and ſee if he haue a beliefe in the bloud of Chriſt, or not: whether hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue to obtaine mercy by his merits, and ſanctification by his bloud, or not. For if thou haue no meaſure of this faith, thou haſt no meaſure of peace with GOD, by reaſon our peace with God, is ingendered and groweth dailie more and more by true faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Novv this faith, vvhere it is true, where it is liuely, and couples the heart vvith GOD, as I haue alreadie ſaid, it muſt breake foorth in voord and deede, it can by no meanes bee held in, but it vvill break forth. It muſt breake out in word, in
<pb facs="tcp:20181:109"/>glorifying the God of heauen, who hath forgiuen vs our ſinnes; it muſt break forth in word, by giuing a notable confeſsion of thoſe ſinnes wherein vvee haue offended him. It muſt breake out in deed, in doing good works, to teſtifie to the world, that thing which is within thy hart; to teſtifie to the world, that thou, who haſt this faith, art a new man; that by thy good example of life and conuerſation, thou maiſt edify thy brethren, the ſimple ones of the Church of God; and that, by thy holie life, thou maiſt drawe ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; that they ſeeing thy good light, may bee compelled to glorifie GOD in thee.</p>
            <p>Then, in the firſt poynt of triall, let vs looke to theſe three; to the hart, to the mouth, to the hand. Take heed that there be a harmonie betwixt theſe three; for, if the hart be inwardly coupled with God, there is no doubt, but the mouth vvill outvvardlie glorifie him; and if thy hart and mouth bee renevved, and bee one, of neceſsitie thou wilt expreſſe it in thy conuerſation. There muſt bee an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the heart and the hand, thy conuerſation muſt bee changed with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20181:109"/>the heart, and be holy, honeſt, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the heart is: So that if thy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be good, it is a ſure token, that thou art at one with God: but if thy conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bee not good, ſpeake what thou wilt, thy heart is but defiled; this true, and liuelie faith, hath no place in it. Then wouldeſt thou know, when thou art at one with God? When thy conuerſation, thy heart, and thy mouth ſay all one thing, then without queſtion, thou haſt the worke of fayth, wrought by the holy ſpirit in thy heart, which maketh thee to bee at peace with God. This is the firſt poynt, wherein yee ſhould trie your ſelues.</p>
            <p>The next point, is loue: yee muſt trie, whether ye be in loue, and charitie with your neighbours, or not: for, as thou art not coupled with God, but by the hand of faith; ſo thou art not coupled with thy neighbour, nor ioyned with any member of Chriſt in this world, but by the hand of loue, amitie, and charitie. Take away loue, thou art not a member of this bodie: for loue is the maiſter ſinnowe, and couples all theſe members of Chriſts bodie together, and makes them to growe vp, in a ſpiritual, and myſticall vnitie: loue, is the onely
<pb facs="tcp:20181:110"/>marke, whereby the children of Chriſt, and members of Chriſts bodie, are knowen from the reſt of the world: loue is that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyle that refreſheth our ſoules, &amp; makes vs like vnto God; and the more we growe in loue, the more God by his ſpirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs, for God is loue: So that except in ſome meaſure, loue towards thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, dwel in thy heart, thou canſt haue no ſocietie with thy neighbour, and far leſſe with God. If the manners of men were examined by this rule, wee ſhould finde a multitude of godleſſe people in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, who haue their hearts raging with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, one againſt another: and where the diuell and the malicious ſpirite dwell, there is no place for the holy ſpirit. And although the Lord hath gone about by all meanes posſible, early, and late, to inſtruct them, and to infuſe into them this preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous loue, and amitie towards God, &amp; their neighbour, and ſo to alter their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Yet they will not ſuffer themſelues to be wakened, vntil the great vengeance, and malediction of God fal vpon them: This loue, this honeſt, and godly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation floweth alwaies from the roote of fayth. So that if thy heart haue faith in any meaſure, be it neuer ſo little, in that ſame
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20181:110"/>meaſure, thou muſt haue loue towards thy neighbour: &amp; this loue is neuer idle, but is vttering it ſelfe, in one effect or other: And in reſpect that faith is the ground whereupon all the reſt dependes, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that this fayth is ſuch a Iewell, as without the which it is not posſible for any of you to pleaſe God, without which, all your deedes are abhomination before him, without the which you are in the greateſt miſerie (w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> miſerie is ſo much the more terrible, in that you are ignorant of it) Is it not good reaſon, that ye know, and vnderſtand, how this faith is firſt wroght &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nouriſht, in your ſouls, by the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? that ſeeing how it is created, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it is brought about, ye may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, &amp; ſee whether ye be in the faith or not. My purpoſe was to haue inſiſted longer on this matter, then this time will ſuffer. Now therefore, as time wil permit, and GOD ſhall giue grace, I will let you vnderſtand, how the H. ſpirit imployes his trauaile in the heart &amp; minde of man, &amp; what paines the holy Ghoſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in creating, and forming this Iewell of fayth in your ſoules: Yet, before I enter this work, to let you ſee the trauailes
<pb facs="tcp:20181:111"/>of the ſpirit of God, in working of this fayth in your hearts: It is neceſſarie, and more then neceſſarie, that yee vnderſtand, firſt your owne miſerie, and infirmitie: and that yee knowe, how the Lord was induced to recouer you, out of your old eſtate, and to recreate you, who were loſt, by the fall of your father <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then to conſider of this matter more deepely, I offer to your remembrances this ground: That man vniuerſally, and euery one particularly, being corrupted, being loſt, and that by our firſt fathers fall (for if there were no more, but that ſame firſt faulte and ſinne of his, wee are all of vs iuſtly condemned, to a double death both of bodie, and ſoule for euer) Man, thus vniuerſally, and particularly, being vtterly loſt, without any hope at all of recouery left in his ſoule, without any ſenſe of the recouery of that fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate, or repairing of that Image which hee had loſt through ſinne, long before; hee beeing I ſay loſt by this ſinne, and left in this deſperate eſtate in himſelf: what doth God? The euerliuing God, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe, whoſe waies are vnſearchable, hath found out a way, how that man, this way
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20181:111"/>loſt, yet hee may bee ſaued: heerein hee ſought counſell, from whom? Not from any creature, but hee counſelled with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; The perſons of the Trinitie tooke counſell of them ſelues, one God was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſeeke counſell from himſelfe, only moued in himſelfe: for hee had not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall principall without himſelfe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him. So, he ſeeking this counſaile at himſelfe, and being moued in himſelfe thereto: As <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.9. what doth hee? when all men ſhould haue died for euer, it pleaſed him of his infinite mercie, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect out of all, and to elect a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, out of the loſt race of <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſhould haue periſhed for euer. In this his counſell and decree, moued I ſay of himſelfe, and ſeeking counſell from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe only, he ſelects a certaine number, out of this rotten race, which certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hee will haue ſanctified, hee will haue iuſtified, hee will haue glorified: And therefore to bring to paſſe the worke of their ſaluation: what doth hee? hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointes his owne naturall ſonne (for hee had but one naturall ſonne) hee appointes the ſecond perſon of the Trinitie, his owne naturall ſonne, God, in power, glory, and
<pb facs="tcp:20181:112"/>maieſtie, as high as himſelfe, equall with God the father in all things, hee appoints him to worke this worke, to bring to paſſe this worke of our redemption, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation (This is but the myſterie of it, in ſome meaſure diſcloſed). And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fulnes of time, (for hee diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all things according to his wiſdome) at ſuch time as hee appointed, hee makes his ſonne to come downe, to ſeiſe himſelfe in the wombe of the Virgin, to take on our fleſh, to take on the likenes of ſinne; hee tooke not on ſin, but he tooke on the likenes of ſinne: what call I that likenes? our fleſh is the likeneſſe of ſinne: he tooke on our fleſh, and nature, the likenes of ſin, which was perfectly ſanctified, the verie moment of his conception, in the verie wombe of the Virgin: Hee tooke on this fleſh, that in this fleſh, and nature, ſin might be baniſhed, and caſt out of vs fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: And whereas we ſhould all of vs haue gone one way (for there was no exception of perſons by nature) Chr. Ieſ. our ſauiour, hath elected vs: &amp; according as his father in his ſecret election, before the beginning of the world, had elected vs; the ſame Chr. Ieſus in his owne time, calleth vs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20181:112"/>vs partakers, of that ſaluation, which he hath purchaſed, &amp; he repaires not only that image which was loſt in our forefather <hi>Adam:</hi> he placeth vs, not in a terreſtriall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, where <hi>Adam</hi> was placed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (and what more could haue bin ſought by vs?) but he giues vs a far more excellent image, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we loſt, he placeth vs in a more high, &amp; in a more celeſtial para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we loſt: For ſo much the more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly is the paridiſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he giues vs, as the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> is more excellent then the firſt, and as the ſon of God, &amp; God himſelfe, is farre aboue any creature, that euer was; man, or Angell. Therfore it comes to paſſe, that by the benefit of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chr. Ieſus our Sauior, the ſon of God (whereas had we remained in that Image, wherin our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was firſt created, wee ſhould haue ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled our ſelues in the earth for euer, wee could not haue craued a beter paradiſe then an earthly paradiſe, for earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles) By benefit of the ſonne of God, I ſay, it commeth to paſs, that we are pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp, out of the earth, to the heauen &amp; to a heauenly paradiſe. And what haue wee to doe with heauen? Are wee not made of the earth, to returne to the earth? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not an earthly paradiſe an earthly
<pb facs="tcp:20181:113"/>bodie? yet the Lord in his mercy, ſendeth downe his ſonne, to draw vs vp, out of the earth, to the heauen. This is ſo high a thing that it cannot bee eaſily conſidered. For this drawing of vs, to a heauenly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, is a thing, more then could haue beene thought on. That wee ſhould liue the life of Angels in heauen: how could the heart of man, thinke on this? yet it pleaſed the liuing Lord, in the great riches, and bowels of his mercie, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatnes, of the power of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie towards vs (The Apoſtle in that Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> cannot get words enow to expreſſe this, he knowes not how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, nor how to end, when hee ſpeakes of the riches of that mercie. And if yee looke well into that Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> yee ſhall finde more high, and excellent ſtiles, giuen to the riches of that mercy, in that Epiſtle, then in any other part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) It pleaſed him I ſay, of his own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not to giue vs ſimply the Image which wee loſt, nor to leaue vs, in this earth: but it pleaſed him, to giue vs a better I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and beſide that, to place vs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, there to remaine with him for euer.</p>
            <p>Now, reſteth his mercie and grace
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20181:113"/>heere? No: But that this ſaluation, which hee hath alreadie purchaſed, and brought about, by his ſonne, our Sauiour, Chriſt Ieſus, that it might be wholly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hauing nothing wanting in it: As hee redeemed vs, in his owne perſon perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; So, he makes this ſame redemption to come to our knowledge, and make vs ſure of it in our conſciences: and to this end, what doeth hee? As by his death, he purchaſed our full redemption, ſo hee makes it knowen vnto vs, hee intimates it vnto vs; by our inward calling, letting vs both finde, and feele in our hearts, what hee did in his bodie for vs. For our Lord when hee makes his ſeruants, to proclaime this redemption, and to intimate it to our conſciences, hee workes this Iewell of faith in our ſoules, which aſſures vs, that the ſon of God, hath died for vs: For what could it auaile vs, to ſee our redemption, to ſee our ſaluation, and our life, a farre off, if a way were not found out, &amp; a hand, and meanes giuen vnto vs, whereby wee may apprehend that ſaluation, and applie it to our ſelues. What can it auaile a ſicke man, to ſee a drugge in an Apothecaries ſhoppe, except hee may haue it, and apply
<pb facs="tcp:20181:114"/>it to his ſicke bodie? So, to the ende that this worke of our redemption, and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may bee fully, and freely accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: looke, how freely, hee hath giuen his onely ſonne, to the death of the croſſe for vs; as freely hath hee found out this way, and meanes, and offered vs this hand, whereby wee may take hold on Chriſt, and applie him to our ſoules: This meanes, to conclude, is faith: There is not a way, nor an inſtrument in the Scriptures of God whereby we can applie Chr. to our ſoules, but only the inſtrument of faith: therfore, fayth cannot be enough co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. Turn to faith, &amp; it will make thee turne to God; &amp; ſo, conioyne thee with God, &amp; make all thine actions, well pleasſing vnto him: There is no good actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we do, though it ſeeme neuer ſo good, before the world, but it is abhomination before God if it be not done in fayth, and will forward our condemnation: hauing fayth, all the creatures of god, are ſeruiceable vnto vs, they muſt all conſpire to the furtherance, of the worke of our ſaluation: As on the contrarie, wanting fayth, there is none of the creatures of God, but ſhall bee ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto vs, and conſpire to our dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20181:114"/>For fayth conioynes vs, with the God of heauen, and makes vs heauenly: This Iewell of faith, ſeaſons all the gifts, &amp; graces, which God giueth vnto vs: All the riches of the earth, is of no value to my ſoule, without fayth. And what auailes it any man, to haue all the knowledge, and wiſdome in the earth, without fayth? For the diuell hath all this knowledge, and is not the better. What auailes it me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all the Monarches, kingdomes, and whole riches in the earth: what can all theſe auaile my ſoule? Nothing but accuſe mee, if I want fayth. Therefore, all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and gifts of God, without faith auail nothing, but to augment our miſery: All the gifts, and graces of God are abuſed, without fayth: Fayth onely makes thee to vſe the benefits, and graces of God right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Fayth onely ſhould bee ſought, kept, and intertained, heere in this life: hauing fayth, all the reſt of Gods graces, are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto thee, for this Iewell keeps them al in order, &amp; makes them al fruitful; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, wanting this iewel, there is nothing here on earth, but it wil teſtifie againſt thee.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by nature wee are, not only woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and launced by ſinne, and iniquitie, but as the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>wee were wholly dead, in treſpaſſes and ſinnes:</hi> yea, obſerue, how voide any dead bodie is, of a naturall life, ſo voide are our ſoules (though they be liuing the naturall life) ſo voide are they, of the life of God, of that heauenly and ſpirituall life, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, wee in this life doe aſpire: vntill ſuch time, that the ſpirit of God draw our harts, and mindes, that is quicken, our harts, and mindes. No, it is not a drawing as wee commonly ſpeake, it is a very quickning of a dead thing: It is a quickning of that thing, which was voide of the life of the ſpirit. Then except the ſpirit of God
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20181:115"/>drawe vs, that is, quicken vs, with that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and heauenly life, it is not posſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs, to come to heauen. And except hee nouriſh this life, which hee hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, it is not posſible, that wee canne ſtand in this life: So the ſpirit of God, is ſaid to drawe vs, that is, to beginne this life in vs, and by the ſame holy ſpirit, to continue, and nouriſh this life in vs. Now by the drawing of the ſpirit, our ſoules are quickned: and by the drawing of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I vnderſtand no other thing, but the framing, and creating of fayth in our ſoules which makes vs new creatures. Now let vs ſee, what order the ſpirit of GOD keepeth, in drawing vs, and informing, and creating this faith, in our ſoules: Firſt of all, I diuide the ſoule, into no more parts then commonly it vſeth to bee diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that is, into the heart, and the minde. Our minde then being a cloud of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, altogether blinde naturally, there being nothing in that minde of ours; but vanitie, error, and ignorance, whereby wee vaniſh away, and can neuer long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in any good reſolution, or purpoſe; What doth the ſpirit of God? The firſt worke, that euer the ſpirit of God doth,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:116"/>he taketh order with the minde: and what doth hee to the minde? he baniſheth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he chaſethout vanitie, and blindnes, that naturally lurketh in the mind; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of this darknes, he placeth in the minde, a light, a celeſtiall, and a heauenly light, a light which is reſident in Chriſt Ieſus only: Then, the ſpirit chaſeth out that cloude of miſte, &amp; darknes, and placeth light in the minde. And what worketh he by this light? We getting this inward, and heauenly light in the minde, &amp; a ſanctified vnderſtanding, incontinent hee makes vs to ſee God: not only as he is God the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the world; but alſo as hee is God the redeemer, and hath redeemed vs in his ſon Chriſt Ieſus. Now before I obtaine this light, what is my heart, &amp; mind doing? There is not one of you, but haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as I my ſelfe haue, in what eſtate the heart, and minde is, before that this light enter: The minde lieth drowned in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the heart is hardned, and they both conſpire together in vice, to ſette vp an Idoll in ſtead of God, a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and inuiſible Idoll: what ſort of Idoll is that? No doubt, ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or fleſhly affection, or other: this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20181:116"/>is ſette vp, in the throne of thy heart; and on this Idoll, thou beſtoweſt the ſeruice of thy whole heart, of thy whole minde, of thy whole ſoule, and bodie: So, that the ſeruice both of the ſoule, and bodie, which ſhould be beſtowed vpon God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is imployed vpon that Idoll, which is ſet vp in thy heart, that is, in the place of God, in the ſteed of the moſt high God: And thou art more addicted, to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of that Idoll, then euer thou waſt, to the ſeruice of the liuing God: yea, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time, that this Idoll of ours bee baniſhed, and that this blindnes, whereby this Idoll is ſerued, be taken away, there is not one of you, but are ſeruants to one luſt or other; &amp; thy ſoule, that ſhould bee conſecrated to the ſeruice of the liuing GOD, is imployed vpon one affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or other, vpon ſome worldly or fleſhly luſt, of thine owne: But from the time, that the Lord beginneth to ſcatter the cloudes of our naturall mindes, and vnderſtandings, and beginneth to chaſe away this thicke miſt, of the darke ſoule, and placeth therein, ſome ſparke of heauenly light, which floweth out of Chr. and whereas we were children of the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:117"/>night, and darkneſſe before hee makes vs to be light in the Lord, and to be children of the light, and of the day. Then we ſee, that all the things in the world, beſides the liuing God, are vanities, deceiueable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, vnconſtant ſhadowes, fleeting, and flowing without any abiding: and and then wee ſee, that our hearts, and our mindes, were ſette on euill continually. Then wee beginne to abhor that Idoll, and to ſeeke to ſerue God only. Now except the Lord of his mercie, and goodnes, place in vs this light, vntill ſuch time as we get ſome glimmering of this light, wee canne neuer ſee our own vanitie, nor yet ſee God.</p>
            <p>This then is the firſt worke of the ſpirit, hee baniſheth darkneſſe, and errors, and placeth light in our mindes. Now this firſt worke of the ſpirit, is tearmed oftentimes in the Scripture, vnder the name of fayth: for the minde hath it owne aſſent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in the owne kinde, as well as the heart hath: and therefore the minde bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing illuminate, &amp; ſeaſoned with this light, the aſſenting, and knowledge in the ſame minde, is called faith. The Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts, giue to this knowledge, the name of fayth: for from the time, that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20181:117"/>thou once haſt an eye to ſee God, &amp; whom he hath ſent, Chriſt Ieſus, when once thou getteſt a ſight of him, and acceſſe to him, if it were no more then in the minde, it is called faith.</p>
            <p>But wee muſt not ſtand ſtill heere: If faith goe no further then the minde, it is not the faith that wee are ſeeking. For the faith that iuſtifieth, and doth vs good, muſt open the hart, as well as it openeth the minde; it muſt baniſh that Idol and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection out of the hart, and in ſteed therof, place a throne for Chriſt Ieſus. So, that except the good ſpirit of God, goe further then the minde, and baniſh this Idol, as vvell out of our hearts, as out of our mindes, we haue not that iuſtifying faith, wherby we may looke for mercy. Yea, the ſpirit of GOD muſt not onely ſtay at the inlightening of thy mind, but it muſt mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie this hart of thine, and change thine affections. And vvhereas thy affections were wicked, and euill, Gods Spirit muſt change thy will: and he neuer can change thy will, except he make the ground of thy hart good, that it may be ſet on God, and bring forth good fruit aboundantly to the owner.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:118"/>
            <p>And what teacheth this? This teacheth you to ſeeke for an honeſt hart, and to ſeeke inſtantly, while yee obtaine it. For, what auaileth it any man, to knowe vvhat is good, or what is euill, except hee haue a way ſhewed him, how hee ſhall eſchew the euill, &amp; a meanes giuen him, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe partaker of the good?</p>
            <p>Is not this an idle, and vnprofitable knowledge to mee, to ſee a farre off, and to knowe that this is good for me, when I finde not a meanes, how to be partaker of that good, that it may be eſpecially good to mee? Is it not an idle knowledge alſo, to perceiue that this is ill for mee, that it vvill doe mee hurt if I doe it; and yet, that ſame verie thing I vvill doe, and no other?</p>
            <p>So the Spirit of GOD, linketh theſe two together in this worke; and as hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the minde, hee reformes alſo the hart, and makes you to be partakers of that good, which yee ſee; and to eſchew that euill which ye perceiue. And this is the ſecond worke of the Spirit, Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preſent a thing to thee, but to make it thine in effect. For, howbeit the minde would doe his part neuer ſo well, and let
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20181:118"/>thee ſee that Chriſt is thine, and preſent him to thee neuer ſo often; yet if thy hart be not reformed, that will, and crooked affection that is in thy hart, will preferre it ſelfe to Chriſt, and vvill make thee to account all but folly, in reſpect of that Idol.</p>
            <p>And therefore, it were an idle, and a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thing for mee to ſee my ſaluation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I get grace to be partaker of it: and what auailes it thee, to ſee the works of the diuell, to ſee thine owne ſinnes, that ſlay thee, except thou get grace to eſchew them? And ſo the ſecond worke of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is this, Hee enters into the hart, hee daunteth the hart, and wonderfully chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, making the wil of it obedient: hee mollifies the affection, which was hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in ſuch ſort, that it is made to poure out thy affection in ſom meaſure, on the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, wheras it was poured out on one Idol or other of thine owne before. Then, except the hart will do his part, as the mind doth his part, the whole ſoule is not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to God: for God hath not made the ſoule, that the hart ſhould ſerue thee, and the mind only ſhold ſerue him; but thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is then only acceptable to God, when
<pb facs="tcp:20181:119"/>thou conſecrateſt thy hart, as well as thy minde to him.</p>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the corporall foode, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the ſpirituall.</note> this matter is ſo cleare, that it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to be illuſtrated by ſimilitude: yet to make it more plaine vnto you, I vvill ſhew you by a ſimilitude, that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the minde is not enough, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee get the apprehenſion of the hart alſo. In corporall things, in meat &amp; drink, which ſerue for the vſe of your bodies, there muſt be of this meat and drinke, two ſorts of apprehenſions: and as there is two ſorts of apprehenſion, of the meat and drinke, that is the foode of the body: ſo there is two ſorts of apprehenſion of the body, and bloud of Chriſt Ieſus, which is our meate and drinke ſpirituall. Of meat and drinke corporall, there is an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion by the eye, and by the taſte: that while the meate is preſent vnto you on the Table, your eye taketh a view of that meat, diſcerneth it, and maketh choice of it: and not onely the eye, but alſo the taſte diſcerneth the meat, and the taſte ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing it, that is called the firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
            <p>Now, vpon this which is the firſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond apprehenſion followeth: that is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20181:119"/>that ye haue chewed that meat, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, &amp; ſent it to your ſtomack, where it digeſteth, and conuerteth into your nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riture; then in your ſtomack, ye get the ſecond apprehenſion. But if your eye like not that meat, neither your taſte like it, the ſecond apprehenſion followeth not; for thou wilt ſpet it out againe, or reiect it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring ſome other meat vnto it, that thou likeſt better. That meat which thou likeſt not, enters neuer into thy ſtomack, and ſo it can neuer be conuerted into thy nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: for, it is onely the ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the meat, that is the cauſe of the nouriſhment of the body, in our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall foode; ſo that if yee chew not this meat, and ſwallow it, it feeds you not; then it is onely the ſecond apprehenſion that nouriſheth our bodies.</p>
            <p>It is euen ſo in ſpirituall things (ſo farre as they may be compared) in the foode of Chriſt Ieſus, who is the life, and nouriture of our ſoules and conſciences. There muſt be two ſorts of apprehenſion of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. The firſt apprehenſion is, by the eye of the minde; that is, by our knowledge, &amp; vnderſtanding: for, as the eye of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, diſcerneth by an outward light; ſo the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:120"/>eye of the minde, diſcerneth by an inward, and renewed vnderſtanding, whereby wee get the firſt apprehenſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now, if this firſt apprehenſion of Chriſt like vs well, then the next followeth: Wee beginne to caſt the affection of our harts on him; we haue good will to him: for all our affections proceed from our will, and our affections beeing renewed, and made holy, wee ſette them wholly vpon Chriſt. We loue him; and if we loue him, we take hold on him, we eate him, and digeſt him; that is, we apply him to our ſoules: and ſo, of this loue, and liking of him, the ſecond apprehenſion doth follow. But if we haue no will to him, if wee haue no loue, nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him, what doe we? Then we reiect him, and preferre our owne Idol, and the ſeruice of our own affections, to him; and ſo the ſecond apprehenſion followeth not. Wee cannot digeſt him; and if wee digeſt him not, that ſpirituall life cannot growe in vs: for marke, in vvhat place the eye ſerues to the bodie, in the ſame roome, ſerueth knowledge, and vnderſtanding to thy ſoule: and looke in vvhat place, thy hand, and thy mouth, thy taſte, and thy ſtomack, ſerue vnto thy body, in that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20181:120"/>very place, ſerue the hart, and affections to thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>So that, as our bodies cannot be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, except our hands take, and our mouthes eate the meate, whereby the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond apprehenſion may follow: likewiſe, our ſoules cannot feede on Chriſt, except we hold him, and imbrace him hartilie, by our wills, and affections. For we come not to Chriſt, by any outward motion of our bodies, but by an inward motion, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the hart. For God finding vs all in a reprobate ſenſe, he brings vs to Chriſt, by reforming the affection of our ſoules, by making vs to loue him. And therefore, the ſecond apprehenſion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee digeſt our Sauiour, will neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into our ſoules, except, as hee pleaſeth the eye, ſo he pleaſe the will, and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo.</p>
            <p>Now, if this come to paſſe, that our wills &amp; affections, are wholly bent vpon Chriſt; then, no doubt, vvee haue gotten this Iewell of faith. Haue yee ſuch a liking in your minds, and ſuch a loue in your harts of Chriſt, that ye will prefer him, before all things in the world? then, no queſtion, faith is begun in you.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:121"/>
            <p>Now,
<note place="margin">How faith is nouriſhed and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in vs.</note> after a thing is begunne, there is yet more required: for though this faith be formed in your mindes, in your harts, and ſoules, yet that is not enough; but that which is formed, muſt be nouriſhed; and hee who is conceiued, muſt be entertained and brought vp: or elſe, the loue that is begunne in mee, by the holy ſpirit, except by ordinary meanes it be daily entertained and nouriſhed, it will decay: except the Lord continue the working of his holie Spirit, it is not poſsible that I can continue in the faith.</p>
            <p>And how muſt we nouriſh, and continue faith in our ſoules? Two manner of waies. Firſt, wee nouriſh faith begunne in our ſoules, by hearing of the word; not of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie word, but by hearing of the vvord of God preached: and not by hearing of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, but by hearing the word preached by him that is ſent. For this is the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie means wherunto the Lord hath bound himſelfe; hee will work faith, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, and the receiuing of the Sacraments. And the more that thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the vvord, and the oftner that thou receiueſt the Sacraments, the more thy faith is nouriſhed.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:20181:121"/>
            <p>Now, it is not onely by hearing of the word, &amp; receiuing of the Sacraments, that we nouriſh faith. The word, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are not able of themſelues to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh this faith in vs, except the working of the holy Spirit be conioyned vvith their miniſtery. But the word, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are ſaid to nouriſh faith in our ſoules, becauſe they offer, and exhibite Chriſt vnto vs, who is the meat, the drink, and life of our ſoules: and in reſpect that in the word and Sacraments, wee get Chriſt, who is the foode of our ſoules, therefore the word and Sacraments, are ſaid to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh our ſoules. As it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>The Diſciples of Chriſt, continued in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine, and fellowſhippe, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, and prayers;</hi> by theſe means, entertaining, augmenting, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faith that was begunne in them. Then the holy Spirit begets this faith, works this faith, creates this faith, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, and entertaineth this faith in our ſoules, by hearing of the word preached, and by the receiuing of the Sacraments: which are the ordinary meanes, whereby the Lord nouriſheth vs, and continueth this ſpirituall foode with vs. For, obſerue
<pb facs="tcp:20181:122"/>by what meanes the ſpirituall life is begun, by the ſame meanes, it is nouriſhed, and entertained; as this temporall life is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and nouriſhed, by the ſame meanes, whereby it is begun.</p>
            <p>Then ſeeing by theſe meanes,
<note place="margin">Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the holy Spirit begets this vvorke of faith in our ſoules: It is our dutie to craue, that hee would continue the worke which hee hath begunne. And for this cauſe, we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the hearing of the vvord, when it is preached, and to the receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, when they are miniſtred, that we may be fedde in our ſoules to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
            <p>But alas, wee are come to ſuch a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſdaine, or reiecting of heauenly foode in this Countrey, that where men in the beginning, would haue gone, ſome twentie miles, ſome fortie miles, to the hearing of this vvord: they vvill ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie novv, come from their houſes, to the Church, and remaine there but one houre to heare the vvord, but rather abide at home. VVell, I ſay, too much vvealth vvith-drawes their hearts; and the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this vvord, ingenders ſuch a loathſomneſſe, that it is a rare thing to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20181:122"/>finde out any, that haue that thirſt, and deſire to heare the vvord, as they vvere wont to haue in the beginning.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe that are in higher places, they will heare it ſildome, or not at all: for they cannot indure to heare the thing that accuſeth them, and conuicts them, and therefore they auoyde it. But they ſhould not doe ſo, they ſhould not ſhunne Chriſt, nor abſtaine from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is vvord that accuſeth them: but they ſhould heare the vvord; and as the vvord accuſeth them, they ſhould accuſe themſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; that thereby, they may come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of their ſinne, and obtaine mercy for the ſame.</p>
            <p>So, vvhen Chriſt accuſeth thee, thou ſhouldeſt not runne from him; but thou ſhouldeſt draw neere to him; thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt threaten kindneſſe of him, and, as it vvere, make a breach, and forcible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into his kingdome. It is not the way, vvhen thy ſinnes touch thee, and when Chriſt accuſeth thee, to runne from him: no, thou ſhouldeſt then turne to him, thou ſhouldeſt confeſſe thy ſinne, cry <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caui,</hi> and ſeeke mercy: and after that thou haſt obtained mercy, this word ſhal becom
<pb facs="tcp:20181:123"/>as pleaſant to thee, and thou ſhalt take as great delight to come to the hearing of it, as euer thou delightedſt to flie from it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But alas! our lothſomneſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine is growen to ſuch an height, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am moued to belieue firmly, that the Lord hath concluded, that we ſhal not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his reſt, &amp; that onely for the great contempt of his mercy, and grace, which is now ſo richly offred. For why? God can not deale otherwiſe with vs, then hee dealt with our fore-fathers, the Iſraelites, for the negligence of his vvord, vvhich was but then obſcurely preached: for then it was farre from the incarnation of Chriſt; and the farther that it was from his incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the vvord was euer the more obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, vnder darke types, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. Yet notvvithſtanding, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that heard that word preached, and belieued it not, they periſhed all in the Wilderneſſe, except two; as ye haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time heard out of this place.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20181:123"/>now, in the preaching of the Goſpell; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord in his mercy preuent you; and except ye preuent his Iudgements, by earneſt ſeeking; and except ye ſeeke a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſeeke inward ſenſes, that ye may ſee, &amp; feele, the grace that is offered; craue againe, that he will ſanctifie your harts by repentance, that yee may repent you of your ſinnes, and lead an honeſt, &amp; a godly conuerſation, in all time to come; that both body and ſoule may be ſaued in the great day of the Lord. The Lord worke this in your ſoules, that ye may ſeeke mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and ſeeking mercy, yee may obtaine mercy; and in mercy, ye may lay hold on Chriſt, and that for his righteous merits.

            <p>IN the doctrine of our triall, and due examination, the Apoſtle, as ye haue heard (vvel-beloued in Chriſt Ieſus) gaue vs a ſpeciall commaund, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs, ſhould try, and examine narrowly our ſelues: that is, that euery man ſhould condiſcend, and enter into his owne conſcience, try, and examine the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of his own conſcience, in what eſtate he findes it with God; and in what eſtate he findes it with his neighbour. Hee inioynes this triall to our ſelues, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands, that euery one of vs ſhould take pains vpon the true examination of our conſciences. Hee inioynes this work to vs, why? Becauſe no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20181:124"/>man knoweth ſo much of me, as I doe my ſelfe; becauſe no man can be ſure of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of my conſcience, but I my ſelfe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man can ſo diligently, nor ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably try my conſcience, as I my ſelfe. Therefore, chiefely it behooueth euery man, and woman, before they enter to the hearing of the word, before they giue their eare to the vvord, or their mouth to the Sacrament; it behoueth them to try, and examine their owne conſciences. Not, that the Apoſtle vvould ſeclude the triall of other men: for, as it is lawfull for mee, to try my ſelfe; ſo, no doubt, it is lawfull for my Paſtor to try mee. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for other men, that haue a care ouer mee, to try, and examine me: but no man can doe this ſo profitably to mee, as I my ſelfe. And though wee had neuer ſo many tryers and examiners, all is nothing, if wee try not our ſelues. So, whether there be a ſecond, or a third tryer, and examiner, let our ſelues be one, and the firſt. And no doubt, the Apoſtles minde was this, To let vs ſee clearlie, that hee that commeth to that Table, and hath not that knowledge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or is not of that ability to try him-ſelfe, is a profane commer, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vncleanly;
<pb facs="tcp:20181:125"/>and therefore, muſt needs come to his owne deſtruction. Let euery man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore growe in knowledge, growe in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, growe in the ſpirit, that hee may be the more able, to try, and examine his owne conſcience.</p>
            <p>To the end that ye may goe forward, &amp; proceed in the worke of this triall, with the better ſpeed, and with the better fruits; in this examination, we laid down this order. Firſt of all, I ſhewed, what that is which we call a conſcience, and what is meant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Next, I declared, for what cauſes yee ſhould put your conſciences to this triall, and narrow examination. And thirdlie, ſo farre as time ſuffered, I entred into the points, wherein euery one of you ſhould try, and examine your owne conſciences. As for conſcience, that yee may call that definition to your memory, I will reſume it ſhortlie. We call a conſcience, a certain feeling in the hart, reſembling the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudgement of GOD, following vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a deed done by vs, flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the mind. A feeling, accompanied with a motion in the hart; a motion, either of feare, or ioy, trembling, or reioycing. I leaue the opening vp of theſe parts, to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20181:125"/>your memories, and I pray God, that they may be well ſanctified. I come next, to the cauſes, wherefore euerie one of you ſhould bee carefull in trying, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your owne conſciences. The firſt cauſe is, becauſe the Lord of heauen, hath his eye continually vpon the conſcience: the eye of God, is neuer from the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and heart of man, as I proued to you by diuerſe places. Next, becauſe this God hath choſen his lodging, and hath ſet downe his throne, to make his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the conſcience: Therefore, that hee may dwell in cleaneneſſe, yee ought to haue a regard to his dwelling place. Thirdly, he is the Lord, yea, the only Lord of this conſcience, who hath power onely to controle, who only hath power to ſaue, or to caſt away: therefore, that it may doe good ſeruice, to thy owne Lord, thou oughteſt to take heed to thy conſcience. And laſt of all, in reſpect that the health of thy ſoule, ſtandeth in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of thy conſcience, and if thy ſoule be in good health, thy bodie cannot bee ill: Therefore, in reſpect that the ſoule, and bodie, depend vpon the eſtate of the conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, euery one of you, ſhould careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:20181:126"/>looke to your conſciences: I will not amplifie this, but leaue it to your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: how the health of the ſoule, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the ſoule, ſhould be kept. Next, I come in the third, and laſt place to the points, in the which, euerie one of you, ſhould trie, and examine your conſciences. And as yee may remember, I ſet downe two points, wherein ye ought to put your conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences in triall: Firſt, to know whether your conſciences were at peace with God, or not: Secondly, whether your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, were in loue, in charitie, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with your neighbour, or not: In theſe two points cheefly, yee muſt trie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelues. To know, whether ye bee at peace with God, or not, ye muſt firſt trie, whether yee be in the faith or not (as the Apoſtle ſaith) whether yee bee in the faith of Chriſt, or not: For being in the faith, and iuſtified thereby, on necesſitie, yee muſt haue peace with God. Then the next care muſt bee, to try your faith, and to ſee whether ye haue faith, or not. Faith can no waies be tried, but by the fruits: faith cannot be iudged on by me, that looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it only, but by the effects. Therefore, to try whether ye be in the faith or not, mark
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20181:126"/>the fruits; Take heed to thy mouth, take heed to thy hand, take heede to thy words, and to thy deeds: for except thou glorifie God in thy mouth, and confeſſe to thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; except thou glorifie him alſo in thy deedes, &amp; make thy holy life, a witnes of thy holy faith, all is but vaine, all is but meere hypocriſie:
<note place="margin">How a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere faith is knowen.</note> Therefore to knowe the ſinceritie of thy faith, thou muſt take heede, that there be a harmonie, between thy hand, thy mouth, and thy hart, that there be a natural conſent, that thy doings preiudge not thy hart, that thy mouth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge not thy heart, but that mouth, and hand may teſtifie, the ſinceritie of the hart: If the heart, the hand, &amp; the mouth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, &amp; agree in one harmonie together; No queſtion, that heart that breakes forth into ſo good fruits, is coupled with God; There is no queſtion, the light of thy actions, the beames and ſhining of thy life, ſhall make the name of thy good God, to bee glorified.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the whole weight of our triall, ſtandes cheefely vpon this point, to ſee whether wee bee in the fayth, or not; to trie and examine, whether Chriſt dwell in vs by fayth, or not:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:127"/>for without fayth, there canne be no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, or conioyning betwixt vs, &amp; Chriſt; without faith, our hearts cannot bee ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and cleanſed; and without faith, we cannot worke by charitie: ſo all depends, on this onely. And therefore that yee might the better vnderſtand, whether yee haue fayth, or no: I was ſomewhat the more exact in this matter, and I beganne to let you ſee, how the holy ſpirit createth faith, &amp; works faith in your ſoules, hearts, and mindes: I began to ſhewe you, what order the holy ſpirit kept, in forming, and in creating this notable inſtrument, in your hearts, and mindes. Not onely, how hee ingenders, and begins fayth, but alſo, how he intertaines it, how he nouriſheth it. And I ſhewed you, the externall means, and inſtruments, which hee vſeth to this effect: To beget faith in our ſoules, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit vſeth the hearing of the word, preached by him that is ſent, &amp; the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Sacraments, as ordinarie meanes, and inſtruments: which ordinary meanes, are onely then effectuall, when as the holy ſpirit, concurs inwardly in our hearts, with the word ſtriking outwardly in our eares, and with the Sacrament out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20181:127"/>receiued: And except the holy ſpirit grant his concurrence to the word, and Sacrament; word, and Sacrament both will not worke faith. So, all depends, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the working of this holy ſpirit: The whole regeneration of mankind, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the heart, and of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, depend on the power of the holy ſpirit; And therefore it behoueth vs, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to imploy our ſelues, in calling vpon God for his holy ſpirit. By the ſame means, and no other, that the holy ſpirit beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts faith in vs, by the ſame meanes, hee nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, and augments that, which hee hath begotten: And therefore, as we got faith by the hearing of the word, ſo by continuall, and diligent hearing, we haue this faith augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, &amp; nouriſhed in vs. And from hence I tooke my exhortation, That if yee would haue that ſpirituall life nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in you, and if yee would haue a further aſſurance of heauen; of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, yee muſt both continually, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, heare the bleſſed word of God.</p>
            <p>Now it reſteth, that euery one of you carefully apply this doctrine to your owne ſoules, and enter into the triall of your owne conſciences, To ſee if this faith,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:128"/>as I ſpake, be begunne in your hearts, and mindes, or not: how farre, or how little, the holy ſpirit hath proceeded in that worke, trie with mee, and I with you. The firſt effect of the holy ſpirit, whereby yee may trie your mindes, whether yee be in the faith, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not, is this: Reuolue in your memories, and remember, if at any time, it pleaſed the Lord, in his mercie, to turn the darkneſſe of your mindes into light, to cauſe that naturall darkneſſe, which was within you, to depart: Through the which darkneſſe, neyther had yee an eye, to ſee your ſelues, what you were by nature, nor yet had ye an eye, to ſee God in Chriſt, nor anie parte of his mercie. Examine I ſay, whether this darkneſſe of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnderſtanding, bee turned into light, by the working of the ſpirit, or not: If thou art become a childe of the light, a childe of the day; If thou art become (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) light in the Lord: If there bee this alteration made in thy minde; That whereas naturally before, it was cloſed vp in darkneſſe, whereas it was filled with vanities, and errors, wherens it was cloſed vp, in blindnes: If the Lord hath at anie time, inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20181:128"/>the eye of thy minde, and made thee to ſee thine owne miſerie, to ſee the vglineſſe of thine owne nature, to ſee the heinous ſins, in the which by nature thou lieſt; If hee hath granted to thee, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of thy ſelfe, in ſome meaſure; and on the other ſide, if hee hath granted thee the remedie, and hath giuen thee, an inſight of the mercie of God, in Chriſt Ieſus, if thou haſt obtained an inſight of the riches of his grace in Chriſt; No doubt, the holy ſpirit hath begunne a good worke worke in thee: A worke, which will bring forth repentance, which in his owne time, hee will perfect: So this is the firſt care, which yee ought to haue, and the firſt point, wherein yee ought to examine your minds, To ſee, if there bee any light in it, whereby, yee may know your miſerie, and haue an inſight of the free mercie of God, in Chriſt Ieſus. This being done, that thou findeſt a ſight of theſe two in thy minde, from thy minde goe to thy heart: and as thou haſt tryed thy minde, ſo try thy heart: And firſt, examine thine heart, if it bee altered, or not, that the will of it, bee framed, and bowed to GODs
<pb facs="tcp:20181:129"/>obedience, that thy affection bee turned into the life of God, and bee poured out on him, as it was poured out on vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, on filthineſſe, and on the world before. Try, whether the ground of thy heart, and the fountaine from whence thy motions, and affections proceede, bee ſanctified, or not: for from a holy fountaine, holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt diſtill: from a holy fountaine, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions, holy cogitations, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied conſiderations, muſt flowe.</p>
            <p>Trie then, and examine your hearts, if the ſpirit of God hath wrought any ſuch reformation, as I ſpeake of in your harts, or not. And that ye may perceiue the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the holy Spirit the better in your hearts, and conſciences (for the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath his chiefe reſidence in your hearts) I will declare vnto you, the firſt effect, that euer the holy ſpirit bringeth forth in the heart, in framing it, in molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it, and in bowing it, vnto the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God: You ſhall knowe the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy ſpirit, by this effect: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if your mindes ſee, and behold, what is ill; ſee, and behold what is good; perceiue, and diſcerne your owne miſerie, and your ſinnes, which haue brought this miſerie
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20181:129"/>vpon you; and withall perceiue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, the riches of the mercie of God in Chriſt Ieſus: If as your mindes ſee theſe two, your hearts be reformed &amp; prepared to loue the ſight of them: and as you ſee in your mindes the mercy of God, and that in Chriſt, if yee haue hearts, to deſire mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if ye haue a thirſting, and earneſt deſire, to be partakers of mercy; where this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and thirſt is, there the holy ſpirit is, hee hath no doubt, opened the heart: On the other ſide if, as thou ſeeſt mercie, thou ſeeſt thy miſerie; if, as thy mind ſeeth thy miſerie, it ſeeth alſo the fountaine, from whence thy miſerie floweth, to wit, from thine owne ſinnes; if then, thy hart alſo hate this, the holy ſpirit is there; if as thou ſeeſt ſinne, which is the cauſe of thy miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with the eye, which is giuen thee in the minde; thou hateſt this ſinne with thy heart, no queſtion, the holy ſpirit is there: And as thou hateſt it, if alſo thou ſorrowe for it (for it is not enough to hate it, if thou lament not the committing of it, and with a godly ſorrowe deplore it) the holy ſpirit is there. And thirdly, if with thy lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, thou haſt a care, and a ſtudy to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew that ſin, (for what auailes it to lament,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:130"/>if, like a dogge, returning to his vomit, thou fall into that ſame gulfe againe?) Therefore, where there is an hatred of ſinne, a ſorrow for ſinne, a care, and a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to eſchewe ſinne; no queſtion, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, hath opened the heart, and is working out that pretious inſtrument. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all this in a word, all the operation of the holy ſpirit, and working in the hart, and by this, examine thine heart: See, and perceiue, if the holy ſpirit hath entred ſo farre in thee, to worke in that hard heart of thine, an earneſt, and a diligent ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, a carefull ſolicitude, continually to bee reconciled with the great God, whom thou haſt offended: Is there ſuch a thing, as a thirſt, as a deſire, to bee at amitie with him, whom thou haſt offended, to bee reconciled with the God of heauen, whom thou haſt offended by thy manifold tranſgresſions? where this care and ſtudy of reconciliation is, if this care, and ſtudy, of reconciliation bee in the heart, there is no doubt, but the heart that thirſteth for this reconciliation, is heartily content not onely to renounce ſinne, to renounce all the impieties, that ſeparated thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; but, the heart that is indued with this thirſt,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20181:130"/>wil be hartily content, to renounce it ſelfe, to caſt downe it ſelfe, as ſtubborne as it was before, to caſt downe it ſelfe, at the feete of the mightie God, and be wholly content, at all times after, to be ruled by his holy will: Not to follow it owne luſt, it owne will, and appetite, as it did before, but to reſigne it ſelfe, wholly into the handes of the mightie God, to bee ruled by his will, at his pleaſure, and to obey his commaundes. And except yee finde this diſpoſition in your owne hearts, To acquite your ſelues, to renounce your ſelues, it is a vaine thing for you to ſay, that yee haue a thirſt to bee reconciled: So, the greater thirſt of reconciliation that we haue, &amp; the more that the care, &amp; ſtudy ther of groweth, the greater that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of my miſerie, of the deep gulfes, and very hels (whereunto my ſoule is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect) increaſeth in my ſoule the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt would would I be, to bee reconciled: And to bee reconciled, I would not ſtand, for the renouncing, of the luſts of my heart, but I wold renounce my hart, &amp; the obedience of the wil, &amp; deſire: why? Becauſe I ſee I muſt die for euer except the Lord reconcile himſelf with me: I ſee the huge
<pb facs="tcp:20181:131"/>deepes, and oceans of all miſerie, into the which I ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al in the ende, except in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the Lord reconcile himſelfe with me. To eſchewe theſe miſeries, and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is there any queſtion, but the hart, that hath any ſenſe, and is touched with them, will moſt willingly endeuour, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite it ſelfe? Againe, ſeeing the Lord hath taken paines, to deliuer mee out of that deepe miſerie, in the which I had drowned my ſelfe, and hath purchaſed my redemption, by ſo deere a price, not with golde, nor with ſiluer, or any droſſe on the earth, but by ſuch a wonderfull means, by ſuch a pretious price, and rich ranſome; Looking to the greatneſſe of our miſery, and to the greatnes of the price, whereby hee hath redeemed vs, What heart is it, but would willingly renounce it ſelfe, to get a part of that redemption, and to be deliuered out of that hell, wherein wee are preſently, and wherein wee ſhall be in a greater meaſure heereafter, except wee bee reconciled? So then with this, there is ioyned a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>poſition in the heart, whereby the heart is willing in ſome meaſure, to renounce it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This leſſon is often taught vs by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20181:131"/>our Sauiour Chriſt, wee muſt both take vp the croſſe, and renounce our ſelues alſo, before that wee canne follow him. The more that this thirſt groweth in the heart, the more this renouncing of our ſelues groweth in the heart: the more that this thirſt decayeth, and is diminiſhed in the heart, the more, wee cleaue to the world, the more wee loue the fleſh, and the more are wee ruled and guided by them: So, eyther wee muſt nouriſh a thirſt of righteouſneſſe, a hunger of life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, a thirſt of mercie, a hunger after that iuſtice, that is in Chriſt, or it is not posſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in any meaſure, wee can bee his diſciples.</p>
            <p>Now to proceede: The heart, that after this manner is prepared, that with a thirſt to bee reconciled, is reſolued alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it ſelfe, This heart, in the which there remaineth ſo earneſt a thirſt, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fruſtrate of the expectation, is neuer diſappointed; But as the Lord hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it, an earneſt ſtudie to be reconciled, and to lay hold on Chriſt: So in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eie, hee grants vnto that heart, the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſesſion of mercie; hee puts that heart in ſome meaſure in poſſesſion of mercy,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:132"/>which it ſeeketh, in poſſesſion of Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, whom it ſeeketh: The which apprehenſion which it hath of Chr. the heart ſenſiblie feeleth, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in that peace, which hee giueth to the conſcience: So that the conſcience, which was terrified, exceedingly gnawen, and diſtracted before; by the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of this peace, &amp; of Chriſt with his graces, incontinent it is quieted, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, there commeth a calmeneſſe, and ſoundneſſe into the heart, and all troubles, and ſtormes are remoued: with this peace, is conioyned a taſte of the powers of the world to come; The heart gets a taſte of the ſweetneſſe that is in Chriſt, of the ioy, which is in the life euerlaſting, which taſt is the onely earneſt pennie of that full and perfect ioye, which ſoule, and bodie in that life ſhall inioye: And the earneſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (as yee know) muſt bee a part of the ſumme, &amp; of the nature of the reſt of the ſumme: And therefore that earneſt penny of ioy, aſſures vs, that when wee ſhall get poſſesſion of the whole ſumme, it it ſhal be a ſtrange ioy: And theſe documents lift vp the heart, and make it, not to linger, nor wearie in the expectation of that life:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20181:132"/>but being refreſhed now, and then, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, by ſo many earneſt pennies, they aſſure vs, of the full fruition of that ioye, for the which in patience wee will ſuſtaine all troubles: So, as the holy ſpirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket a thirſt in vs, to bee with Chriſt, a thirſt of mercy, and reconciliation with him; The ſame holy ſpirit diſappointeth not that ſame expectation, and thirſt, but putteth the ſoule and heart in poſſesſion of Chriſt, by the which the conſcience is pacified, the heart is reioyced, and we get a taſte of the ſweetnes, and of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that life to come: The ſenſible fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the which taſte, that paſſeth all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vnderſtanding, what doth it in my heart and conſcience? It worketh a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull aſſurance, and perſwaſion, that God loueth mee: The feeling of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in the bowels of my heart, in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of my conſcience, worketh a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aſſurance, and perſwaſion that he is my God, that he will ſaue me, for Chriſts cauſe, that the promiſe of mercie, which I durſt not apply vnto my conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce before; now, by the feeling of mercy I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applie, and ſay mercie appertaineth to me; life, &amp; ſaluation belongeth to me:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:133"/>For the conſcience being exceedingly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and ſeeing nothing in God, but fire, and wrath, it is not posſible, but it muſt ſhe from him, it cannot approche to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire. But from the time, that the conſcience getteth a taſte of this peace, mercy, and ſweetnes; how faſt ſoeuer it fled from the preſence of God before, now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this reconciliation, it will runne as faſt to him, and will poſſeſſe him, more and more fully. So the aſſurance, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mercie, ariſeth from the feeling of mercie, in the hart, and conſcience. And except the heart feele it, and taſte it in ſome meaſure, no conſcience dare apply God and his mercie, to it ſelfe: I may be ſure in generall, that all my ſinnes are remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and that I may obtaine mercie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I feele it: But, to applie this mercy, particularly to my ſelfe, vntill I feele a taſte of it, I dare not: So, this particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, whereby wee claime God, and Chriſt, as a propertie to vs, as if no man had title to him, but wee, and to call him my God, my Chriſt; and to claime his promiſes, as if no man had intereſt in them, but wee; This commeth of the ſence, and feeling of mercie, in the hart:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20181:133"/>and the more that this feeling grovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the greater experience that we haue in our owne harts of this peace and mercy, the more increaſeth our faith and aſſurance. Our perſwaſion becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo ſtrong, that wee dare at the laſt ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>What can ſeparate vs from the loue of GOD? Neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, ſhall be able to ſeparate me, from the loue of GOD, which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This particular application, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth (no doubt) vpon the feeling, and ſenſe of mercie, is the ſpeciall difference, the chiefe mark, and proper note, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our faith, vvho are iuſtified in the bloud of Chriſt, is diſcerned from that generall faith of the Papiſts. Our faith, by this particular application, is not onely diſcerned from the generall faith of the Papiſts, but it is diſcerned from all the pretended faiths of all the Sects in the world. For, the Papiſt dareth not apply the promiſe of mercie to his owne ſoule: he accounteth it preſumption, to
<pb facs="tcp:20181:134"/>ſay, <hi>I am an elect, I am ſaued, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</hi> And from whence floweth this? Onely from hence; That in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, they haue neuer felt mercie, they haue neuer taſted of the loue, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and ſweetnes of God. For, looke hovv faſt the conſcience flieth from GOD, before it gette the taſte of his ſweetneſſe; it runneth as diligently to him, and threatneth loue on him, after that it hath gotten that taſte.</p>
            <p>So, they, miſerable men, content themſelues with this generall faith, which is no other thing but an hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call faith, which groundeth onely on the truth of GOD; whereby I knowe, that the promiſes of God, are true. But the Papiſts dare not come, and ſay, They are true in mee. Why? Becauſe they haue not felt it; and their harts are not opened. But our iuſtifying faith, as I told you, conſecrateth the whole ſoule, vnto the obedience of God, in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So that it reſteth not onely vpon the truth of GOD, nor it reſteth not onely vpon the power of God, (though theſe be two chiefe pillars of our faith alſo)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20181:134"/>but eſpecially, and chiefely, it reſteth vpon the mercy of God, in Chriſt. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth alſo, vpon the truth, and power of God; but eſpecially, vpon the promiſe of grace, and mercy in Chriſt. The ſoule of the Papiſt, beeing deſtitute of the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and taſte of mercy, dare not enter into this particular application, &amp; ſo he cannot be iuſtified. Yea, no doubt, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, as are iuſtified in the mercy of God, get a taſte of this mercy &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, before they depart this life. Thus farre concerning the effects.</p>
            <p>Then yee haue onely this to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; The opening of the hart, the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying &amp; quieting of the conſcience, they worke an aſſurance &amp; a ſtrong perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mercy of God, in Chriſt. The more that the hart is opened, the more that the conſcience is pacified, the more that the taſte of that ſweetnes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and remaineth, the more art thou aſſured of Gods mercy. So then, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou knowe whether thy faith be ſtrong, or not, vvhether thy perſwaſion of Gods mercy be ſure, or not? Looke to thy conſcience.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:135"/>
            <p>If thy conſcience be wounded, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly thou vvilt doubt: and if thou doubteſt, thou canſt not haue ſuch a ſtrong perſwaſion, as otherwiſe thou wouldeſt haue, if thy doubting were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued. Not, that I will haue faith to be ſo perfect in this life, that there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies no doubting ioyned with it; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not that perfection: but, I ſay, that a wounded conſcience muſt euer doubt; and the more wee doubt, the leſſe is our perſwaſion. So, the more that thou woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thy conſcience, the leſſe faith thou haſt. Then thou muſt come to this poynt; Keepe a ſound conſcience; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine peace in thy conſcience; &amp; thou ſhalt keepe faith, and ſhalt haue thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in that ſame meaſure, that thou haſt of reſt and peace in thy conſcience: and the more that thy conſcience is at peace and reſt, the greater ſhal thy faith and perſwaſion be.</p>
            <p>So, this ground is certaine; A doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcience, cauſeth a weake faith; and the more the doubting in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is, the weaker is thy faith. Then true it is, that the Apoſtle faith, That
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20181:135"/>faith dwelleth in a good conſcience; that faith is locked, and cloſed vp in a good conſcience. So that if yee keepe a good conſcience, ye ſhall keepe a ſtrong faith: and if yee wound your conſciences, yee ſhall wound your faith.</p>
            <p>Novv, to make this more ſenſible; How can I be perſwaded of his mercie, whoſe anger I feele kindled againſt me; and againſt whom, my conſcience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, that I am guilty of many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. No queſtion, ſo long as the ſenſe of his anger, &amp; feeling of my offences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, I cannot haue a ſure perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that hee will be mercifull vnto mee: but, when I get acceſſe vnto his preſence, and a ſight that hee hath forgiuen mee, then I begin to be ſurely perſwaded. So then, keepe a good conſcience, and thou ſhall keepe faith; and the better that thy conſcience is, the ſurer vvill thy faith be.</p>
            <p>Then,
<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the whole exhortation that we gather from this point, dependeth vpon this; That euery one of you, in vvhat rank ſoeuer ye be, take heed vnto your conſciences: for loſing it, yee loſe faith;
<pb facs="tcp:20181:136"/>and loſing faith, yee loſe ſaluation. Are ye in the ranke of great, and rich men? yee ought to take heed vnto your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: eſpecially, in reſpect that the Lord hath placed you in a higher cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Ye haue many things wherein yee ought to controle your conſciences; ye ought to craue the aduiſe of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, before yee attempt any great worke, in reſpect that yee are bound in manifold duties to God, &amp; to your infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioure.</p>
            <p>And no doubt, if ſome great men had aduiſed well with their conſciences, ſuch diſſolutions had not fallen out in their owne houſes, ſuch oppreſsions of the poor, deadly feudes with men of their own rank, would not haue burſt forth in ſo high a meaſure. But the Lord, ſeeing them take ſo little care vnto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, depriueth them of faith, and of the hope of mercy; and their end will be miſerable. Yee ſhall ſee, that the GOD of heauen, will make thoſe who liue ſo diſſolutely, ſpectacles of his iudgements vnto the world; for, the Lord leaueth not ſuch men vnpuniſhed.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:20181:136"/>
            <p>By their examples, it vvere very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that men of inferiour ranke ſhould take heede vnto their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: and therefore, iet euery man, according vnto his calling, examine his calling, by the rule of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Let the Iudges, before they giue, and pronounce foorth Iudgement, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe vvith their conſciences, &amp; the lavv thereof; and in Iudgement, not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their affections, but to follow the rule of their conſciences. Likevviſe, they that are of inferiour degree vnto Iudges, let them controle their dooings, by their conſciences; and giue not the poore ſubiects iuſt cauſe to complaine on them. Let them not terrifie them, from the pleading of Iuſtice, by exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant prices, and extraordinarie kinde of dealings: but let them moderate all their actions ſo, that they agree vvith the rule of their conſciences; that ſo far as in them lyeth, Iuſtice ceaſe not. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Merchants; let not them looke ſo much, to this, or that, as to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is in them; what in conſcience
<pb facs="tcp:20181:137"/>they may doe, according vnto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge, that GOD hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in them; and whatſoeuer they doe, let them beware that they doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their knowledge.</p>
            <p>I grant their knowledge, will not be ſo learned as it ſhould be; and this maketh many deformed actions: yet, let no man doe againſt his knowledge; but let euery man doe, according vnto the meaſure of knowledge wherewith God hath indued him. And, though it be not well refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet do not any thing by gueſſe, but aduiſe well with thy conſcience, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy knowledge: for, that which is done doubtingly, is ſinne. So, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou dooſt, let not thy eye, thy hand, nor any member of thy body, doe againſt thy knowledge: for this is a ſteppe to that high ſinne againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>This is the ready way to put all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge out of your mindes: for if men do againſt knowledge, and continue in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt knowledge; at the laſt, they will become a maſſe of darkneſſe, the Lord will ſcrape out all knowledge out
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20181:137"/>of their mindes, and all feeling of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy out of their harts. Therefore let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man follow his knowledge: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of his knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, let his actions proceed.</p>
            <p>It hath pleaſed the Lord,
<note place="margin">Faith is the free gift of God.</note> to poure this liquor, this precious ointment into vs: though we be earthly, and fraile veſſels, miſerable creatures, yet it hath pleaſed our gracious God, to poure ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious liquour into our harts and minds; and to credit ſuch a Iewell in our kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that by vertue thereof, wee may take hold on Chriſt; who is our iuſtice, our wiſedome, ſanctification, &amp; redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Though vvee be miſerable creatures, yet the Lord of his mercy hath a reſpect to vs, in Chriſt, in giuing vs this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquour, whereby our ſoules may be ſeaſoned to life euerlaſting. In this, that he poures it into our harts, we ſee cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it growes not in our harts, nor breedes not in our nature. No, this gift of faith, is not at mans commaund, nor vnder his arbitrement, as if it were in his power, to belieue, or not to belieue, as
<pb facs="tcp:20181:138"/>hee pleaſeth. It is the gift of God, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe freely, of his vndeſerued grace, in the riches of his mercie in Chriſt. That it is a gift, yee ſee clearlie, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. vvhere the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>And to another, is giuen faith by the ſame ſpirit.</hi> As alſo, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. <hi>For, vnto you it is giuen for Chriſt, that not onely yee ſhould belieue in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> So faith is the gift of the holie Spirit: and this gift is not giuen to all men and women, as the Apoſtle plainly declareth; <hi>All haue not faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gift, though it be giuen, it is not giuen to all, but is onely giuen to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: that is, to ſo many as the Lord hath appointed to life euerlaſting. This gift, where-euer it is, and in what hart ſoeuer it be, it is neuer idle, but perpetuallie working; and working well, by loue, and charitie, as the Apoſtle affirmeth, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 5.6. This gift, vvhere-euer it is, is not dead, but quick, and liuely, as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> teſtifieth, in his ſecond chapter.</p>
            <p>And, to let you knowe whether it be liuely, and working, or not, there is no
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20181:138"/>better meanes, then to looke vnto the fruites, and effects that flowe from it. And therefore, that yee, by your owne effects, may be the more aſſured of the goodneſſe of your faith, I will giue you three ſpeciall effects to obſerue, by the which yee may iudge of the goodneſs of your faith.</p>
            <p>Firſt, looke to thy hart,
<note place="margin">Certaine effects, whereby we may know if wee haue faith.</note> and caſt thine eye on it: If thou haſt a deſire to pray, a deſire to craue mercy for thy ſinnes, to call vpon Gods holy Name for mercy and grace: if there be ſuch a thing in thy hart, as a deſire to pray, if thy hart be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and hath a thirſt to ſeeke after mercie, and grace; though the greateſt part of thine hart repine, &amp; would drawe thee from prayer, yet aſſuredly, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that thou haſt in any meaſure to praier, is the true effect of the right faith. If thou haue a hart to pray to GOD, though this deſire be but ſlender, aſſure thy ſelfe, thy ſoule hath life: for prayer is the life of the ſoule, and maketh thy faith liuelie. And why? Prayer is Gods ovvne gift; it is no gift of ours; for if it vvere ours, it vvould bee euill:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:139"/>but it is the beſt gift, that euer God gaue man; and ſo it muſt bee the gift of his owne holy Spirit; and beeing his owne gift, it muſt make our faith liuely. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, thou art not able, nor thou da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not call vpon him, in whom thou belieueſt not, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. For if I intreat him by prayer, I muſt truſt in him. Then prayer is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine argument of iuſtifying faith, and beliefe in GOD: for I cannot ſpeake to him, much leſſe pray to him, in whom I truſt not. And though the hart be not fully reſolued, and well diſpoſed, yet if there be any part of the heart that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to prayer, it is a ſure gage, that that part belieueth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond effect, wherby thou ſhalt knowe, whether faith be in thee, or not, is this: Obſerue, &amp; aduiſe with thy ſelfe, if thy hart can be content to renounce thy rancour, to forgiue thy grudges, and that freely, for Gods cauſe. Canſt thou doe this? And vvilt thou forgiue thy neighbour, as freely as God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen thee? Aſſuredly, this is an effect of the right ſpirit; for Nature could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20181:139"/>giue that. There is nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto Nature bendeth it ſelfe more, then to rancour, and enuy; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherein Nature placeth her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour more greedily, then in priuy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</p>
            <p>Now, if thy heart bee ſo tamed and brought downe, that it will vvillinglie forgiue the iniurie, for Gods cauſe, this is the effect of the right ſpirit. This is not my ſaying, it is the ſaying of Chriſt himſelfe, in the Euangeliſt <hi>Math.</hi> 6.14. where hee thus ſpeaketh; <hi>If yee doe forgiue men their treſpaſſes, your heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father vvill alſo forgiue you.</hi> And in the fifteenth verſe, <hi>But if yee doe not forgiue men, their treſpaſſes, no more will your heauenly Father forgiue you your treſpaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that Chriſt ſaith, Hee that forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wrongs, ſhall haue wrongs forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him: but hee that will reuenge his wrongs, wrong ſhall be reuenged vpon him. Therefore, as thou wouldeſt bee ſpared of thy wrongs done vnto the mightie GOD, ſpare thou thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. I will not inſiſt; examine vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:20181:140"/>yee haue faith, or not; examine it by prayer, examine it by the diſcharge of your owne priuie grudges: for, if yee want theſe effects, a hart full of rancor, a hart voide of prayer, is a hart faithleſs, and meet for hell.</p>
            <p>The third effect of faith, is compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thou muſt bow thy hart, &amp; extend thy pitty, vnto the poore members of Chriſt his body, and ſuffer them not to want, if thou haue: for, except yee haue this compaſsion, yee haue no faith. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelues, by theſe three ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and if yee finde theſe in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, though neuer ſo ſmall, you haue the right faith in your harts; the faith that ye haue, is true, and liuely: and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredlie, GOD vvill be mercifull vnto you.</p>
            <p>This faith of ours,
<note place="margin">Our faith muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually nouriſhed, becauſe it is ioyned with doubting.</note> though it be liuely, yet it is not perfect in this world; but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, &amp; euery houre, it needeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall augmentation, it craueth euer to be nouriſhed: for the which increaſe, the Apoſtles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.5. ſaid, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe, commandeth vs to pray, and ſay, <hi>Lord
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20181:140"/>increaſe our faith: I belieue, Lord help my vnbeliefe.</hi> Then by Chriſt his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, we plainly ſee, that this faith needeth continually to be nouriſhed, &amp; helped; and it cannot be helped, but by prayer: therefore ſhould we alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in prayer. That this faith ſhould be helped; and that we ſhould be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually vpon our guarde, in feare &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, to get it augmented, the terrible doubtings, the wonderfull pits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, into the vvhich the deareſt ſeruants of GOD are caſt, doe dailie teach. For the beſt ſeruaunts of GOD, are exerciſed with terrible doubtings in their ſoules, with wonderfull ſtamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and they ſhal be brought at ſome times, as appeares in their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the very brinke of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe doubtings, &amp; ſtammerings, lets vs ſee, that this faith of ours, would be perpetually nouriſhed; and that wee haue need continually to pray for the increaſe of it. It pleaſeth the Lord at ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to let his ſeruaunts haue a ſight of them-ſelues, to caſt them dovvne, and to let them ſee how vgly ſinne is:
<pb facs="tcp:20181:141"/>It pleaſeth him to let them fall, into the bitterneſſe of ſinne; And to what end? Not that hee will deuoure them, and ſuffer them to be ſwallowed vp of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cryeth out, That like an hungry Lyon, the Lord is like to deuoure him, and bruiſe him in pce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet the Lord ſuffers him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire. And though <hi>Dauid</hi> cry, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with this conſuming fire; I cannot endure the fire of the Lords Ielouſie; yet hee deſpaireth not. But the Lord caſteth his ſeruants very lowe. To what end? To the end that they may feele in their harts, &amp; conſciences, what Chriſt ſuffered for them on the Croſſe, in ſoule and body. Yea, we would think, that there had been plaine colluſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father, and the Sonne, &amp; that his ſufferings had been no ſuffering, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we felt in our ſoules, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the hell vvhich hee ſuſtained in full meaſure.</p>
            <p>So, to the end that wee might cleerly vnderſtand the bitterneſſe of ſinne, that vvee might knovve how farre wee are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20181:141"/>indebted to Chriſt, who ſuffered ſuch torments for our ſinnes, and that vvee may be the more able to thank him, and to praiſe his holie Name, hee ſuffers his owne ſeruants to doubt, but not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire; hee forgiues their doubtings, he forgiues their ſtammerings, and in his owne time, hee ſupports them, &amp; brings vs vnto the waters of life.</p>
            <p>Theſe doubtings,
<note place="margin">Doubting and faith may lodge in one ſoule.</note> as I haue often ſaid, may lodge in one ſoule, with faith; for doubting, and faith, are not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie oppoſite: onely faith, and deſpayre are oppoſite; and therefore, faith, and deſpaire, cannot both lodge in one ſoule. For, deſpaire ouerthroweth the pillars of hope; and where there is no hope, there can be no faith. But as for doubting, it may lodge, it vvill lodge, and hath lodged, in the ſoules of the beſt ſeruaunts that euer God had. Mark the ſpeech of the Apoſtle, <hi>Wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in doubt,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>but wee deſpaire not.</hi> So doubting, and faith, may lodge in one ſoule.</p>
            <p>And from whence floweth this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? VVee knowe, that in the regenerate
<pb facs="tcp:20181:142"/>man, there is a remnant, corruption: for we haue not our heauen in this earth; though wee beginne our heauen heere, yet we get it not fully heere. And if all corruption vvere avvay, vvhat ſhould there vvant of a full heauen heere? So, it is onely begunne in this life, and not perfected: therefore, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in the ſoule, a great corruption, which is neuer idle, but continually oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied.</p>
            <p>This corruption, is euer bringing foorth the birth of finne, more, or leſſe; euery ſinne hurts the conſcience: a hurt conſcience impaireth the perſwaſion, and ſo comes in the doubting. For, there is not a ſinne that we commit, but it baniſheth light, and caſteth a myſt ouer the eye of our faith, whereby wee doubt, and ſtagger in our ſight: and were it not, that the Lord in his mercy taketh vs vp, giueth vs the gift of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and maketh vs euery day, as oft as wee ſinne, to cry as oft for mercy, and ſo to repaire the loſſe that wee haue of faith, to repayre the loſſe that vvee haue of the feeling of mercie, we would
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20181:142"/>wholly put out that ſame light. But it pleaſeth the Lord, though wee be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day ſinning, to giue vs the gift of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and by repentance, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire our faith; to repaire the ſenſe, and feeling of mercie in vs, and to put vs in that ſame ſtate of perſwaſion wherein wee were before. Therefore, if GOD beginne not, continue not, and end not with mercie, in that very moment that hee abſtracts his mercy from vs, wee will decay. So wee muſt be diligent, in calling for mercy; wee muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant continually, in ſeeking to haue a feeling of mercie. Thus much for the doubting.</p>
            <p>Novv, howſoeuer it be ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<note place="margin">A doubting and weake faith, is faith, &amp; ſhal neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</note> that the faith of the beſt children of GOD, is often ſubiect to doubting; yet it is as ſure and certaine, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wholly extinct: albeit it were neuer ſo vveake, yet it ſhall neuer vtterlie decay, and periſh out of the hart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it once maketh reſidence. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort &amp; conſolation, the Spirit of God hath ſette downe in his vvord, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the troubled hart; That hovvſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="tcp:20181:143"/>faith be weake, yet a weake faith is faith: and where that faith is, there will euer be mercie.</p>
            <p>Yee haue in <hi>Romans</hi> 11.29. that <hi>The gifts, and calling of GOD, are vvithout repentance.</hi> But among all his gifts, that are of this ſort, faith is one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: therefore it cannot be reuoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>Yee haue in <hi>Iude</hi> 3. <hi>That faith vvas once giuen vnto the Saints.</hi> Once giuen, that is, conſtantly giuen, neuer to be changed, nor vtterly taken from them. The Lord will not repent him of this gift: but the ſoule which he hath loued once, he will loue perpetually.</p>
            <p>It is true and certaine, that the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of faith, which are kindled in the hart, by the Spirit of GOD, may be obſcured &amp; ſmothered for a long time; they may be couered with the aſhes of our owne corruption, and with our own ill deedes, and wickednes, into which we daily fall. It is true, that the effects of a liuely faith will be interrupted, and that thy luſts and affections will preuaile for a long time: ſo that when thou lookeſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20181:143"/>on thy ſelfe, vpon the Iudgements of God, that hang ouer thy ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and when thou lookeſt vpon thy diſſolute life, and on the anger of God, againſt this diſſolute life: In the minde, in the hart, and conſcience of him, that hath ſo ſmothered, and oppreſſed his faith, it will oft times come to paſſe, in his owne iudgement, hauing his eyes fixed on himſelfe onely, that hee vvill thinke himſelfe to be a reprobate, to be an out-caſt, and neuer able to recouer mercy.</p>
            <p>Where this corruption burſteth forth in this groſſe maner, after that the Lord hath called thee; looke how ſoone the Lord beginneth to vvaken thee againe, incontinent, thou fixeſt thine eyes vpon thine owne life, and entreſt into a deepe conſideration, as well of the weight of thy ſinne, as of the weight of the wrath of GOD, which thou ſeeſt following thereupon, and art loath to remit theſe cogitations, to thinke vpon the deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mercie of God.</p>
            <p>Reſting on theſe conſiderations, it cannot but come to paſſe, that in thine
<pb facs="tcp:20181:144"/>owne iudgement, thou art an out-caſt. And yet GOD forbidde it were ſo; for though theſe ſparks of the Spirit, be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the corruption that is vvithin thy ſoule, yet theſe ſparkles are not wholly put out.</p>
            <p>And to let you ſee that they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed,
<note place="margin">The ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of faith though they be ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they are not wholly put out, nor are idle.</note> though they break not forth in the outward effects, that the world may knowe thee to be a faithfull man, as heeretofore; yet theſe ſparkles are not idle, and thou ſhall finde them not to be idle in thee. As for confirmation of my Argument, that howſoeuer our bodies are let looſe to all diſſolution, after our effectuall calling within vs in our ſoules: that yet the ſparkles are not idle; ye ſee, that though the fire be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the aſhes, yet it is a fire: there is no man will ſay, that the fire is put out, though it be couered. No more is faith put out of the ſoule, though it be ſo couered, that it neither giue heat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or light outwardly.</p>
            <p>An example of this, we haue cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> after his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, in that Pſalme of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20181:144"/>
               <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51.11. hee prayeth to GOD in theſe words, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence.</hi> And what addeth he? <hi>And take not thy holy Spirit from mee.</hi> Had he not loſt the Spirit, by his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and murther? No: for he would not haue ſaid then, <hi>Take it not from mee:</hi> But, <hi>Reſtore it to mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that he vſeth the like in the verſe following, <hi>Reſtore mee to the ioy of thy ſaluation.</hi> Not that hee wanted the ſpirit wholly; but that the ſpirit lacked force in him, and needed ſtrengthening and fortification: it would be ſtirred vp, that the flame of it might appear. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, in that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh ſo plainely, after his adultery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Take not that Spirit from mee;</hi> it is a certaine argument, that the faithfull haue neuer the ſpirit of God alwaies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, in their greateſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. The ſecond point is this: How proue I that theſe ſparkles are not idle, though the outward effects be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? As <hi>Dauid</hi> felt this in his conſcience, ſo euery one of you, may feele it in your owne conſciences.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:145"/>
            <p>The Spirit of God, in mans hart, can not be idle; but theſe ſparkles, during the time that the body is let looſe to all diſſolutions, theſe ſparkles are accuſing thy diſſolution, are finding fault vvith thy manners: theſe ſparkles, ſuffer thee not to take the pleaſure of thy bodie, without great bitterneſſe, and continuall remorſe. And theſe ſparkles, where they are, will make the ſoule vvherein they dwell, to vtter theſe ſpeeches at one time or other, once in the twenty-foure houres; <hi>Alas, I am dooing the euill, vvhich I vvould not doe,</hi> if I had power or ſtrength to reſiſt my affection: and if I might be maiſter of my affections, I would not for all the world, doe the euill which I doe. Againe, if I had power, to doe the good vvhich I vvould doe, I vvould not leaue it vndone for all the vvorld.</p>
            <p>So, theſe ſparkles, though they haue not ſuch force and ſtrength preſentlie, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to reſiſt the affection, and abſtaine from dooing euill deedes, yet perpetually in the hart, they are finding fault with thy corruption, and ſuffer thee not to take
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20181:145"/>thy pleaſure without paine: but laſt of all, force thee to vtter theſe ſpeeches; <hi>If I had ſtrength to reſiſt, I vvould not doe the euill vvhich I doe.</hi> Where theſe ſpeeches are, no queſtion they are the words of a ſoule vvhich the Lord hath begunne to ſanctifie: and beeing once ſanctified, in deſpight of the diuell, and of the corruption that is in vs, this faith ſhall neuer periſh: but if the whole ſoule, without contradiction, vvith a greedie appetite and pleaſure, be carried to euill, and hath no ſorrow for it, that ſoule is in an ill eſtate; I can looke for nothing in ſuch a ſoule, but death, except the Lord of his great mercy preuent it.</p>
            <p>But where this remorſe, and ſorrow, and ſuch ſpeeches are in the ſoule; that ſoule, in the time that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhall recouer ſtrength. The Lord ſhall neuer ſuffer thoſe ſparkles to bee vvholly taken away; but in his own time he ſhall fortifie them, and make them to breake out before the world, in good works. The Lord, in his owne time, will ſanctifie them, hee will ſcatter the aſhes of corruption, ſtirre vp the ſparkles, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20181:146"/>make them to breake out into a better life then euer they did before; as ye may cleerely ſee, that <hi>Dauids</hi> repentance hath done more good to the Church of God, then if hee had neuer fallen. Thus far concerning the effects.</p>
            <p>Though the effects of repentance bee interrupted,
<note place="margin">Similitudes, ſhewing that the ſparkles of faith, thogh they be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, are not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</note> yet thoſe ſparkles are not extinguiſhed. For, there is no man will thinke, that the fire, vvhich is couered with aſhes, is extinguiſhed; but beeing ſtirred vp in the morning, it will burne as cleerely, as it did the night before. There is no man wil think, the trees, that now in the time of Winter want leaues, fruit, and externall beauty, to be dead. There is no man will thinke, the Sunne to be out of the firmament, though it be ouerſhadowed with a clowd of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and miſt. There is great difference between a ſleeping diſeaſe, and death: for men are not dead, though they be ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; and yet there is nothing liker vnto death, then ſleep. As there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a drunken man, and a dead man; ſo there is great odds, betwixt the faith that lieth hid for awhile, &amp; vttereth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20181:146"/>not it ſelfe, and the light that is vtterly put out.</p>
            <p>When we breake not forth into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard deedes, GOD forbid that vvee ſhold think, that theſe ſparkles are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſhed. Indeed, the ſoule which is viſited, after foule and heinous back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings from his calling, and againſt his knowledge, before this foule recouer the former beautie, it is in a ſtrange danger. For if the Lord ſuffer thy corruption to get looſe, in ſuch ſort, that it cary thee, as it will, and by all meanes poſsible, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thee to labour, to put out the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of regeneration; vvhen the Lord beginnes to challenge thee, or to make thee render an account of this life paſt, the ſoule of that man, when it is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, is in great danger.</p>
            <p>So that, no queſtion, when the Lord beginnes to lay to your charge, your diſſolute life, the contempt and abuſe of your calling: aſſuredly, your ſoules are ſo neere to the brinke of deſperation, that there can be nothing neerer. For, vvilt thou looke to GOD? thou vvilt ſee nothing, but his anger kindled,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:147"/>as a fire againſt thee: wilt thou looke to thy ſelfe, thou wilt ſee nothing but ſinne prouoking his anger: thou wilt ſee the contempt, and abuſe of thy calling, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his anger; thou wilt ſee nothing but matter of deſpaire.</p>
            <p>And what is the beſt pillar, and ſureſt retreat, whereupon ſuch a ſoule, that is ſo neere to the brinke of deſperation, may repoſe?
<note place="margin">A ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on in higheſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> I will ſhew you the helpe whereupon. When thou art aſſaulted, by all the greateſt tentations thou canſt imagine; when there is nothing before thee but death; when thou ſeeſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill accuſing thee, thine own conſcience bearing him witnes againſt thee, thy life accuſing thee, and the abuſe of thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling accuſing thee: whither ſhalt thou goe? Looke back againe to thy forepaſt experience, caſt ouer thy memorie, and remember, if God at any time, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meaſure, hath loued thee; if euer thou haſt felt the loue and fauour of GOD in thy hart and conſcience. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member if euer the Lord hath ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thy hart, that as hee loued thee, thou louedſt him, &amp; hadſt a deſire to obtaine
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20181:147"/>him. Remember this, and repoſe thine aſſurance on this, that as hee loued thee once, he will loue thee euer, and will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly reſtore thee to that loue, before thou departeſt this life. The hart that felt once this loue of God, ſhall feele it againe: and looke vvhat gift, or grace, or what taſte of the power of the world to come, that euer the Lord gaue to his creatures in this life, to that ſame degree of mercy, hee ſhall reſtore his creature, before it depart this life.</p>
            <p>So the ſoule that is toſſed with high aſſaults, and great dangers; where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things will not helpe, it is neceſſary, that it haue recourſe vnto things paſt, and keepe in memory the afore-paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of mercy, which the Lord hath freely ſhewed towards that ſoule. This ſame memory ſhall be ſo pleaſant to the ſoule, that it ſhall ſtay it preſently from deſperation, and vphold it vnto the time the Lord pacifie that hart, &amp; giue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to that ſoule: which beeing done, that ſoule ſhall ſee, that hovv-ſoeuer GOD was angry, hee was angry one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for awhile.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20181:148"/>
            <p>I ſpeake theſe things, not that I think that euery one of you hath taſted of them; and yet in ſome meaſure, the ſeruaunts of GOD muſt taſte of them: and yee that haue not taſted of them, may taſte of them before yee die. And therefore, whether ye haue taſted, or not taſted of them, it cannot be but profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you, to look vp this leſſon in your harts, and remember it faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if the Lord at any time ſtrike at your harts, yee may remember, and ſay with your ſelues, I learned a leſſon, To looke backe vnto my fore-paſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<note place="margin">A leſſon.</note> and thereon to repoſe.</p>
            <p>And though yee be not touched pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently your ſelues, yet when yee viſite them that are troubled in conſcience, let theſe things be propoſed to them as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and vſe them as medicines moſt meet to apply to the griefe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſcience, &amp; ſo ye ſhal reape fruit of this doctrine, and poſſeſſe your ſoules in a good eſtate. Thus farre for the firſt poynt, vvherein euery one of you ought to try and examine your ovvne conſciences.</p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:20181:148"/>
            <p>The ſecond point is this,
<note place="margin">Of loue, which is the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d point of our triall.</note> Try vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee haue loue towards your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or not. For as we are coupled with God, by faith; ſo by the band of loue, we are coupled with our neighbour; and if yee want loue, yee can haue no ſocietie with your neighbour: for, loue is the chiefe &amp; principall branch, that ſprings from the root of faith. Loue is that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall glew, that conioynes all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full members, in the vnity of a myſticall body. And ſeeing that religion was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of God, to ſerue as a path-way, to conuey vs to our chiefe felicity: and happy we cannot be, except wee be like vnto our GOD; like vnto him we can not be, except we haue loue (For, as it is 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.8. <hi>GOD is loue.</hi>) So, ſeeing God is loue it ſelfe, who-ſoeuer will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him, muſt be indued vvith the oyle of loue. This onely one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, teſtifieth to vs, that this loue is a principall head, vvhereunto, all things that are commaunded in religion, ought to be referred.</p>
            <p>To ſpend long time in the praiſe of loue, I hold it not neceſſarie, ſeeing the
<pb facs="tcp:20181:149"/>holy Scripture reſounds, in blaſing the commendations of it: but that we ſpeak not of any thing ambiguous, I will let you ſee, how this word is conſidered, &amp; taken in the Scriptures.
<note place="margin">How the word loue is taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Loue is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either as a ſpring or fountaine, from whence the reſt proceedes; that is, for the loue, whereby we loue God. And as loue commeth firſt from God, and is poured by his holy Spirit into our harts: So it firſt redownds vpward, and ſtrikes backe vpon himſelfe: for the loue of GOD, muſt euer goe before the loue of the creature.</p>
            <p>Next, we take this word, for that loue whereby wee loue Gods creatures, our neighbours; and eſpecially them that are of the family of faith. And thirdly, It is taken for the deeds of the ſecond Table, which flowe from this loue.</p>
            <p>Now, when I ſpeake of loue, I ſpeake of it, as in the ſecond ſignification; to wit, as it is taken for the loue of our neighbour.
<note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of loue.</note> And taking it ſo, I call loue <hi>The gift of God,</hi> poured into the harts of men and women: by the which gift, we firſt loue God, in Chriſt our Sauiour;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20181:149"/>and next, in God, &amp; for Gods cauſe, we loue all his creatures, but chiefly our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, that are of the family of faith, the children of one common father with vs. Wee will examine this definition; I ſay,
<note place="margin">Of our loue toward God.</note> firſt the loue of God, as it commeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> GOD, it returneth to God; as it comes downe from him, ſo it ſtrikes vpward to him againe. And is it not good reaſon? And why? Let thy hart fix thy loue as long as thou wilt vpon the creatures, thou ſhalt neuer be ſatiate, nor thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhall neuer be content, except thou lay hold on God: but if once thou loue God in thy hart, and caſt thy affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon him, &amp; once takeſt hold on him, the longer thou loueſt him, the greater ſatietie and contentment ſhalt thou haue; thou ſhalt not thirſt for any other. For, as to the creatures, there is neuer a creature that God hath created, but it is ſtamped with his owne ſtamp, &amp; euery creature beareth his Image: and looking to the Image of God in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould it not draw thee to him, that thou fix not thy hart vpon the creature? for his owne Image, in his creature,
<pb facs="tcp:20181:150"/>ſhould lead thee to himſelfe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the more that thou knoweſt the creatures, and the greater varietie of knowledge that thou haſt of them, the more ſhold euery particular knowledge of them, draw thee to God: &amp; the more ſhouldeſt thou wonder at thy God, and knowe thy duty towards him. And, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that delight flovveth from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; euery knowledge hath his owne delight; as the variety of knowledge, that ariſeth from the creatures, ſhould make the minde to mount vp, to the knowledge of God: ſo the variety of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that ariſe vpon the diuerſitie of this knowledge, ſhould moue the hart vpward, to the loue of God: and the hart getting hold of God, and beeing ſeiſed with the loue of God, and the minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occupied with the true knowledge of God; ſo ſoone as hart and mind is full of God, the hart is quiet, and the minde is ſatisfied. So that, the more this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge groweth in thy minde, the greater contentment thou haſt; and the more the loue of God groweth in thy hart, the greater ioy &amp; reioycing haſt thou in thy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20181:150"/>ſoule. And why? In God ye haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the creatures, but ye haue himſelfe, beſides the creatures: and therefore, in God, ye haue all the knowledge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that can ariſe of the creatures; and beſide the creatures, yee haue God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, vvho is the Creator. And ſo I ſay, The mind of man, can neuer quiet it ſelfe in the knowledge, nor the hart can neuer ſettle it ſelfe in the loue of naked crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; in reſpect they are flowing, &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as <hi>Salomon</hi> calls them: But in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God, rightly known, and earneſtly loued, the mind ſhal finde a ful reſt, and the hart ſhall haue a perfect ioy. For our affection is ſo inſatiable, that no finite thing thing will ſatisfie it; nor there can be no ſolide ſettling vpon the thing that is tranſitory. So, the loue ought to mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpward, firſt to God; in whoſe face, the hart ſhal find full and perfect ioy.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument that I vſe, is this; Seeing there is onely one precept left by our Maſter, in recommendation to be obſerued by vs; namely,
<note place="margin">Of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour.</note> That eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of vs ſhould loue another: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our wiſe Maſter, vnderſtanding wel, that where loue vvas, there needed no
<pb facs="tcp:20181:151"/>more lawes: that the life of man, by loue onely, behooued to be moſt happy; left onely the ſame, in chiefe recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and takes vp the whole Law &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in one word, <hi>Loue.</hi> And if the hart of man were indued with loue, his life might be moſt happy, and bleſſed: for, there is nothing maketh this life happy, but the reſemblance, and likelihood that we haue with God. The neerer we drawe to God, the more bleſſed is our life; for there cannot be ſo happy a life, as the life of God. In the firſt Epiſt. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 4.8. <hi>God is loue:</hi> therefore, the more we are in loue, the more neer we are to that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py life: for we are in God, &amp; partakers of the life of God. When I ſpeake this, yee muſt not thinke, that loue in God, and loue in vs, is one thing: for, loue is but a quality in vs, and it is not a quality in God. There is nothing in God, but that which is God; ſo loue in God, is his owne eſſence: therfore, the more that ye grow in loue, the neerer ye draw to God, &amp; to that happy, &amp; bleſſed life. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more profitable, more agreeable, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient vnto nature, then to loue; and aboue all things, to loue God. And
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20181:151"/>therefore it is, that God, &amp; his Angels, are moſt happy &amp; bleſſed, becauſe they loue all things, &amp; deſire euer to do good. On the other ſide, there is nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, nothing more noyſome, more hurtfull, and that eates vp nature more, then to burn with enuy and hatred: and therfore it is that the diuells are moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, who torment themſelues vvith continuall malice and hatred; burning with a vehement appetite, to be noyſom to all creatures. So, as the life of the diuel is moſt vnhappy, becauſe he is full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy &amp; malice; ſo our life wil be moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if we be full of loue. I will no further ſpeake of loue: Onely, if yee haue loue, mark the effects of it, ſet down, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.5.6.7. verſes, which effects, if ye haue not in ſome meaſure, yee haue not true loue.</p>
            <p>I end heer.
<note place="margin">Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Ye ſee in what points eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you ought to be prepared: Yee muſt be indued with this loue; &amp; ye muſt be indued with faith; &amp; if ye haue theſe, in any ſmall meaſure, goe boldly to the hearing of the vvord, &amp; to the receiuing of the Sacraments. This is the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we allow of. I grant, the Papiſts
<pb facs="tcp:20181:152"/>haue a preparation, farre differing from this, and therfore they can haue no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the word of God. Laſt of all, ſeeing that we are commanded to try our ſelues; He that lacketh knowledge, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not try himſelfe; A mad man cannot try himſelfe; A child cannot try himſelfe; therfore they ought not to come to the Lords Table. All theſe things being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered aright, he that hath faith, &amp; loue, in any kinde of meaſure, let him come to the Table of the Lord: And all theſe things ſerue, as wel for the hearing of the vvord fruitfully, as for the receiuing of the Sacrament. Therefore, the Lord of his mercy illuminate your mindes, and work ſome meaſure of faith, and loue in your harts, that yee may be partakers of that heauenly life, offered in the vvord, and Sacraments; that yee may beginne your heauen heere, and obtaine the full fruition of the life to come: and that in the righteous merits of Chriſt Ieſus. To whom, with the Father, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, praiſe, and glory, both now, and for euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>
